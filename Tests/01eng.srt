0
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,910
Well, you got no place to go.

1
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:14,053
Your problem is you brought
your queen out too fast.

2
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,318
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?

3
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:24,128
No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.

4
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:26,790
Take care of her man.
Make sure he feels good.

5
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,901
Checkmate.

6
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,614
l don't think we should
see each other anymore.

7
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,831
Shut up!

8
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:05,769
Shut up, you stupid mutt!

9
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,599
You broke up with her
because she beat you at chess?

10
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:10,801
That's pretty sick.

11
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,506
l don't see how l could perform
sexually after something like that.

12
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:17,684
l was completely emasculated.

13
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,479
Anyway, it's not the only reason.

14
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:22,054
-Yeah, what else?
-All right.

15
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,851
You wanna know what
one of her favorite expressions is:

16
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:27,017
''Happy, pappy?''

17
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:29,353
''Happy, pappy?''
What does that mean?

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,363
lf she wants to know if l'm pleased
with something, she'll say:

19
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,125
''Happy, pappy?''

20
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:36,400
-Oh, you're pappy.
-l'm pappy.

21
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,233
-Oh, l get it. l see.
-Yeah.

22
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:42,208
-So that's not so bad.
-Come on. What, are you kidding?

23
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:43,810
So tell her not to say it.

24
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:47,346
l'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,450
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...

26
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,746
...because she shushed you
while you watched TV.

27
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,549
Hey, l got a real thing
about shushing.

28
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,459
What is this?

29
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:03,324
You ever get the feeling like you had
a haircut, but you didn't have one?

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,864
l'm all itchy back here.

31
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,306
-What?
-What is this?

32
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:14,839
What are we doing?

33
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,436
What in God's name are we doing?

34
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,376
-What?
-Our lives.

35
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:22,641
What kind of lives are these?

36
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:27,720
-We're like children. We're not men.
-No, we're not. We're not men.

37
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,756
We come up with all these stupid
reasons to break up with women.

38
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,257
l know, l know. That's what l do.
That's what l do.

39
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,689
Are we gonna be sitting here
when we're 60, like two idiots?

40
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,356
We should be having dinner
with our sons when we're 60.

41
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,835
-We're pathetic, you know that?
-Like l don't know that l'm pathetic.

42
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:48,707
-Why can't l be normal?
-Yes, me too.

43
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,242
l wanna be normal. Normal!

44
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,642
lt would be nice
to care about someone.

45
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,978
Yes. Yes, care.

46
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:03,783
You know who l think about a lot?

47
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:07,053
Remember Susan,
the one that used to work for NBC?

48
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,423
l thought she became a lesbian.

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,460
No, it didn't take.

50
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:16,831
Did l tell you l ran into her last week?
She looked great.

51
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,472
You thought she was
good-looking, right?

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,507
See, there you go again.
What is the difference what l think?

53
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,669
-l was just curious.
-Well, this is it.

54
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,008
l'm really gonna do something
about my life.

55
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,083
l think l'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

56
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,777
George, l am really
gonna make some changes.

57
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:36,185
-Yes, changes.
-l'm serious about it.

58
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,756
-Think l'm not?
-l'm not kidding.

59
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,654
Me too.

60
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,321
Melanie, you can shush me
at every opportunity.

61
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,758
So we're all straightened out?

62
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,924
You happy, pappy?

63
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:52,635
Oh, it's just an expression.

64
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,773
All right. That's very sweet of you.
Okay, l'll call you later. All right. Bye.

65
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,204
Hey.

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,943
Well, l had a very interesting lunch
with George Costanza today.

67
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,984
-Really?
-We were talking about our lives...

68
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,589
...and we both kind of realized...

69
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:12,055
...we're kids. We're not men.

70
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:15,457
So then you asked yourselves,
''lsn't there something more to life?''

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,689
Yes, we did.

72
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,026
Yeah. Well, let me clue you in
on something:

73
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,532
There isn't.

74
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:28,133
-There isn't?
-Absolutely not.

75
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:32,006
l mean, what are you thinking
about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,114
-Well--
-They're prisons.

77
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:38,582
Man-made prisons. You're doing time.

78
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:41,051
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

79
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:43,087
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

80
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:46,693
lt's like you gotta ask permission
to use the bathroom.

81
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,661
''ls it all right
if l use the bathroom now?''

82
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,160
-Really?
-You can forget about watching TV...

83
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,234
...while you're eating.

84
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,270
-l can?
-Oh, yeah!

85
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,704
You know why?
Because it's dinnertime.

86
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,867
-And you know what you do at dinner?
-What?

87
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:06,442
You talk about your day.

88
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:07,706
''How was your day today?

89
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,749
Did you have a good day or
a bad day? What kind of day was it?''

90
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,887
''l don't know. How about you?
How was your day?''

91
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,448
-Boy.
-lt's sad, Jerry.

92
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,387
lt's a sad state of affairs.

93
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:23,186
-l'm glad we had this talk.
-Oh, you have no idea.

94
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,096
-Hey.
-Hey.

95
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:03,066
Three hours of sleep again last night.

96
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,638
Three hours of sleep
because of that dog.

97
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,305
-What dog?
-Why don't you call the police?

98
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,640
-l did, Jerry. They won't do anything.
-Yeah. What dog?

99
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:16,749
There is this dog in the courtyard
across from my bedroom window...

100
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,409
...that never, ever stops barking.

101
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,087
l lost my voice
just screaming at this thing.

102
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,851
l can't sleep. l can't work.

103
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,427
l mean, l just moved.
l can't move again.

104
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,588
What am l gonna do? What?
What am l gonna do?

105
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,395
-Well, there is something you can do.
-What? Kramer, l'll do anything.

106
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,835
Well, what if there should be
an unfortunate accident?

107
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,704
You're gonna rub out the dog?

108
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,110
No, no. Not me.

109
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,442
l just happen to know someone
who specializes...

110
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,610
...in exactly these kinds
of sticky situations.

111
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,120
What, you're considering this?

112
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,824
Just meet with him. See what he has
to say. You got nothing to lose.

113
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,431
l-- l don't really know why l'm here.
Kramer talked me into coming here...

114
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,300
...but obviously l could never
really do anything.

115
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,472
Of course.

116
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,207
Obviously.

117
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,540
Well, so anyway,
l'm sorry for wasting your time.

118
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:25,811
What kind of dog did you say it was?

119
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:32,390
-l don't know. l've never really seen it.
-l see many dogs on my mail route.

120
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,052
l'll bet there's not one type of mutt
or mongrel l haven't run across.

121
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,961
lf you ask me, they have no business
living amongst us. Vile, useless--

122
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:42,728
Newman! Newman!

123
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,495
Stop it.

124
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:47,897
-Anyway.
-Yeah.

125
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,707
Well, l was just curious...

126
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:56,145
...if l were interested
in availing myself of your services...

127
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,217
...what exactly would you do?

128
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,987
Well, Elaine...

129
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:06,122
...there's any number of things
that l could do.

130
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,523
But l can promise you this, though:

131
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,097
This vicious beast
will never bother you again.

132
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,528
So, what's it gonna be?

133
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:16,529
No, l'm sorry. l can't hurt a dog.

134
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,400
-l can't hurt a dog. l can't.
-Wait a minute. l got it.

135
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:23,168
We'll kidnap it. We'll kidnap the dog,
we'll drop him off upstate.

136
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,778
Then he won't bother you anymore
and he won't get hurt.

137
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:28,380
Yeah, l suppose.

138
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,876
l'd have to think about it.
l doubt it, though. l'll let you know.

139
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,181
Of course, take your time.

140
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,847
l'll be here.

141
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,140
All right. Let's do it.

142
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,347
Excellent.

143
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,421
Excellent.

144
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,531
How come you eat your peas
one at a time?

145
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,930
Well, what's the hurry?

146
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,339
Who is it?

147
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:07,481
-lt's George.
-George?

148
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,811
George, what is it?

149
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:15,621
Will you marry me?

150
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,895
-Hello?
-Ma, guess what?

151
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,558
-Oh, my God.
-No, it's nothing bad.

152
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:32,035
-l'm getting married!
-You what?

153
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:36,074
-l'm getting married!
-Oh, my God. You're getting married?

154
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,108
-<i>Yes.</i>
-Oh, l can't believe it.

155
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,907
-Frank, come here.
-You come here.

156
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,413
-Georgie's getting married.
-What?

157
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,348
-Georgie's getting married!
-Get the hell out of here.

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,885
-He's getting married?
-Yes.

159
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:50,046
-To a woman?
-Of course a woman.

160
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:51,418
<i>What does she look like?</i>

161
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,889
l'm sure she's gorgeous.

162
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,620
-What differences does it make?
-ls she pretty?

163
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,627
Yes. What difference does to make?

164
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,129
l'm just curious!

165
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,598
-She's not pretty?
-Let me talk to her.

166
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,066
She wants to talk to you.

167
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:07,900
-Hello?
-Congratulations.

168
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:11,238
l just want you to know
that l love your son very much.

169
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,640
-You do?
-<i>Yes.</i>

170
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:14,041
-Really?
-<i>Yes.</i>

171
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,082
-May l ask why?
-Okay, let me talk to her.

172
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:20,152
-Will you stop? l'm on the telephone.
-Can l talk to her, please?

173
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,093
-Hey.
-Hey.

174
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,827
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

175
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,832
What's the rope for?

176
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,771
Well, how do you like that?
l got rope.

177
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,110
Well, l gotta go.

178
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,175
-The dog. You're getting the dog!
-Kramer, where you going?

179
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:53,912
-Out!
-Don't go. Kramer! Come back.

180
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,556
l got great news!

181
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,982
Well...

182
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:02,385
...l did it.

183
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,858
-Did what?
-l got engaged. l'm getting married.

184
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,968
l asked Susan to marry me.
We're getting married this Christmas.

185
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:12,401
-You're getting married?
-Yes!

186
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:16,536
-Oh, my God!
-l asked her to get married.

187
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,736
l'm a man. Jerry, l'm a man.

188
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,876
And do you know why?

189
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,211
lt's because of that talk we had.

190
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:28,617
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.

191
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,223
That lunch was the defining moment
of my life.

192
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,659
-l'm blown away!
-Are you blown?

193
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,796
-Blown!
-You like that?

194
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,489
-And she said yes?
-Well...

195
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,898
...it took a couple hours of convincing,
but l was persistent.

196
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,630
l was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.

197
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,536
She said yes.
l can't believe my luck...

198
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,577
...that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.

199
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,714
You think she's good-looking, right?

200
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:56,842
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.

201
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:59,315
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.

202
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,784
-A pinkish hue?
-Oh, she's got the hue.

203
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:08,121
So, what's going on with Melanie?
l know you're not getting married...

204
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,695
-...but things are happening?
-Well...

205
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:14,857
...actually, we kind of broke up.

206
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,428
You what?

207
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:19,571
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.

208
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,732
She eats her peas one at a time.

209
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,207
You've never seen anything like it.
lt takes her an hour to finish them.

210
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,972
We've had dinner other times.

211
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:31,879
l've seen her eats corn niblets,
but she scooped them.

212
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:37,113
-She scooped the niblets?
-Yes.

213
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,885
That's what was so vexing.

214
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,699
-What about the pact?
-What?

215
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,392
What happened to the pact?

216
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,697
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.

217
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,772
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?

218
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,399
You stuck your hand out,
so l shook it.

219
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:58,909
l don't know about a pact.

220
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,513
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.

221
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,149
You're getting married.

222
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:07,881
Well, it's not that. l just-- You know,
l thought that we were both--

223
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,080
You thought
l was gonna get married?

224
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,384
Well, maybe not married, but--

225
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,424
l mean, you love Susan, right?

226
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,787
Yeah.

227
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:19,455
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.

228
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,136
Yeah.

229
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,602
So?

230
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:30,272
Yeah.

231
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,406
-This doesn't make any difference.
-No.

232
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:37,775
-So we're still on to see <i>Firestorm</i>?
-Yeah.

233
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,442
l'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.

234
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,587
-Yeah.
-Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

235
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:47,550
Celebrate!
How about some champagne?

236
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,355
-Champagne?
-Yes, come on!

237
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,464
How often do you get engaged?

238
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:53,793
-Come on.
-Okay. All right.

239
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,807
You know what?

240
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,140
No champagne.

241
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,680
Anyway, l'll see you later.

242
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,152
Yeah.

243
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,795
That's it. That's it.
Stop right here.

244
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,631
<i>How much is that doggie</i>
<i>In the window?</i>

245
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,500
Will you shut up?

246
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,574
ls that a new song?

247
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,300
All right, give me the rope.

248
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,309
What? What do you need
a rope for?

249
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,108
-Look, l don't have time to explain.
-Oh, l don't know.

250
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,011
l'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.

251
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,652
-l knew you'd back out.
-Are we doing a bad thing?

252
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,688
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.

253
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,587
They find it and adopt it.

254
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,855
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.

255
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,055
Fresh air, dandelions.

256
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,497
We're doing this dog a huge favor.

257
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,391
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,335
-That's him.
-All right.

259
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,534
l'm going in.

260
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,312
Keep the motor running.

261
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,611
Ready?

262
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,016
-l don't really think l can go.
-Oh, how come?

263
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,651
Well, l didn't really tell Susan
about it...

264
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,851
...and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.

265
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,325
She can come.

266
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,031
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see <i>Firestorm</i>.

267
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,631
She....

268
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,173
She wants to see <i>The Muted Heart</i>.

269
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,209
Oh, <i>The Muted Heart</i>. Glenn Close,
Sally Field. That should be good.

270
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,349
-Yeah. l guess l'll see you later.
-Wait. We can share a cab.

271
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,417
-They're playing at the same Cineplex.
-George, better get ready.

272
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,711
l am ready.

273
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,451
You're wearing that shirt?

274
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:05,256
-Okay, l guess l'll see you down there.
-Yeah.

275
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,433
-What time you got?
-No, l don't wear a watch.

276
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,906
-Well, what do you do?
-Well, l tell time by the sun.

277
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,270
-How close do you get?
-Well, l can guess within an hour.

278
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:21,608
Well, l can guess within the hour, and
l don't even have to look at the sun.

279
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,279
What about at night?
What do you then?

280
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:27,648
Well, night's tougher.
But it's only a couple of hours.

281
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:30,585
-Okay, let's go. Move.
-You got it?

282
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,884
What do you think?
Drive! Drive!

283
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,651
Where is it? Where is it?

284
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,932
This?

285
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,661
-This is the dog?
-Yep.

286
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:46,635
-But it's so small.
-Yeah, but he's a fighter.

287
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,469
That can't be the dog.
You sure you got the right one?

288
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,043
You said the second courtyard.
He was there.

289
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,146
-How could that be it?
-Get him to bark.

290
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,805
-Yeah, l'll know it if it barks.
-All right. Bark.

291
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,212
-Bark!
-Bark!

292
00:17:58,385 --> 00:17:59,784
-Bark!
-Bark!

293
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,181
-Bark!
-Bark!

294
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,122
-Did you like it?
-Yes, it was very, very good.

295
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:11,225
-Do you think he'll ever find her?
-Oh, l sure hope so.

296
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:13,525
How about when Ford
jumped out of that plane...

297
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,565
...and was shooting back
as he was falling?

298
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:19,069
-What about the underwater escape?
-Oh, man.

299
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:27,176
Let's put the radio on.
Maybe there's a news report about it.

300
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,905
Let's dump it. l'm getting antsy.

301
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,516
-Think we're far enough?
-We're nearly to Monticello.

302
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:35,177
Yeah. l think this looks right.

303
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:38,390
All right. Give me the dog.

304
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:42,019
-Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
-There.

305
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:46,665
Okay, boy. This is it.

306
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,097
This is your new home.

307
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,169
Let go. Let go of my shirt.

308
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,705
Come on. Let go of my shirt!
This shirt is from Rudy's!

309
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,188
-Hello.
-MSG's rerunning the Yankee game.

310
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,584
-You watching?
-<i>They are?</i>

311
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:14,989
George, are you coming to bed?
l taped <i>Mad About You</i>.

312
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,026
Yeah, l'll be there in a minute.

313
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,427
What was that?

314
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,091
-Nothing. l gotta go.
-Oh, Mattingly just singled.

315
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:26,099
You know, it was very wrong of you
to back out on that deal.

316
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:29,709
-l just shook your hand.
-That's a deal where l come from.

317
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,605
We come from the same place.

318
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,905
George, l'm starting it.

319
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,208
l gotta go.

320
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,160
Roxy, where have you been?

321
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:32,931
We've been worried sick about you.

322
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,570
What's this?

323
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:45,673
No. No, it's impossible.

324
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,487
lt's impossible.

325
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,389
l don't know how it happened.
We were practically in Monticello.

326
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,996
l mean, how could that thing have
found its way back? There is no way.

327
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:58,921
-Very strange.
-l know.

328
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,897
So tell me, anyway,
who was the big mastermind?

329
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,834
l can't, Jerry. l'm sworn to secrecy.

330
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:12,340
All right. But then l can't tell you
the big news.

331
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,873
News? What news?

332
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,812
Sorry.

333
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:21,078
What? What?

334
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,981
All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.

335
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,591
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.

336
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,819
lt's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

337
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:33,193
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

338
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,698
George Costanza...

339
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,403
Yeah?

340
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,165
...is getting married!

341
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,009
Get out!

342
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,048
Hi.

343
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,517
-You Cosmo Kramer?
-Yes. Yeah.

344
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:58,052
-You recognize this piece of fabric?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's--

345
00:21:58,225 --> 00:21:59,658
What?

346
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,516
Nothing.

347
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,458
-You're under arrest.
-Arrest?

348
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,326
l have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...

349
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,593
...including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.

350
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,230
lt seems as if the springs
were so compressed...

351
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:15,568
-...that they collapsed the right side.
-Newman!

352
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,951
What took you so long?

353
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,520
-What do you think they'll do to us?
-Don't worry about a thing.

354
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:35,718
ln 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.

355
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,559
We'll be back on the street
by lunch.

356
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,131
l gotta make some changes.

357
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:45,703
l'm not a woman. l'm a child.

358
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,500
What kind of life is this?
