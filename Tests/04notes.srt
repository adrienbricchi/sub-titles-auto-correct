00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,973
A new Seinf eld entered the world
in the summer of 2005.

1
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:11,050
Shepherd Kellen Seinf eld

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,382
. . .Sascha and Julian,
on August 22, 2005.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,690
Snooze alarms actually play
a bigger role. . .

4
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:24,263
. . .in the next episode,
''The Hot Tub.''

5
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,960
But we won't give that away here.

6
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:45,008
Tom Gammill and Max Pross
penned 1 3 episodes. . .

7
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:47,677
. . .as one of the show's
most prolific writing teams.

8
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:52,051
The two joined the staff in
the fifth season after clocking time. . .

9
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,820
. . .in the writing rooms
at <i>Saturfay Night Live</i>. . .

10
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:56,987
. . .and <i>It's Garry Shanfling's Show</i>.

11
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,790
Among their earlier hits:

12
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:02,766
''The Glasses,'' ''The Pie,''
and ''The Diplomat's Club.''

13
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,774
The cast first read ''The Wink'' on
Wednesday, September 6, 1 995. . .

14
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,103
. . .after enjoying
Labor Day weekend.

15
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:15,238
They perf ormed the show in front
of a live studio audience. . .

16
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,748
. . .the next Tuesday, September 1 2th.

17
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,032
The term ''blind date''
originated in the 1 920s.

18
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:43,233
It was common among students who
would attend a dance or show. . .

19
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:47,074
. . .with someone previously unknown,
usually the friend of a friend.

20
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:59,720
Jerry actually did date a deaf woman
in ''The Lip Reader.''

21
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,728
Oscar® winner Marlee Matlin played
Laura, the U.S. Open ball girl. . .

22
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:06,890
. . .with a knack f or reading lips,
in that fifth-season episode.

23
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:13,763
It doesn't appear that George
dated a blind woman. . .

24
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,435
. . .during the run of the series, but
we won't rule out the possibility. . .

25
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,945
. . .that it could have happened.

26
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,701
Richard Herd last played Wilhelm
in season six's ''The Jimmy.''

27
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,371
This is his second of 1 1 appearances
as George's Yankee boss.

28
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,637
Herd has amassed quite a credit list
in over 35 years in the business.

29
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,074
He's appeared in dozens of films
and television shows. . .

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,275
. . . ranging from <i>The China Synfrome</i>
to <i>T.J. Hooker</i>.

31
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,546
He served as National Vice President
of the Screen Actors Guild.

32
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,587
We find no medical research
backing George's claim that. . .

33
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,784
. . .the grapefruit juice squirted in his
eye caused his involuntary winking.

34
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:13,259
However, we can off er
the f ollowing medical advice:

35
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:17,097
If you have a f oreign object in your
eye, start by washing your hands.

36
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:19,432
Then try to flush the object out. . .

37
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:23,099
. . . by gently pulling the upper eyelid
over the lower eyelid.

38
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:27,141
This should cause your eye to tear
and should flush the object out.

39
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:30,114
Seek medical attention if
this procedure does not work.

40
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,350
Lepers are people inf ected with
the disease known as leprosy.

41
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,756
They reside in leper colonies in
order to prevent the spreading. . .

42
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,022
. . .of the highly contagious disease,
which was originally thought. . .

43
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,463
. . .to be associated with a curse.

44
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,333
Leprosy aff ects the skin,
mucous membranes and nerves. . .

45
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,103
. . .and in severe cases,
causes disfigurement and def ormities.

46
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:32,009
KRAMER ENTRANCE COUNTER #246

aboard the ship: Phil Morris. . .

69
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,867
. . . best known as Jackie Chiles,
played Chief Purser Will Sanders.

70
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,640
Fans of the ''The Switch'' may
remember Clive Rosengren (Waiter).

71
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,973
He played Mr. Clotworthy in
that sixth-season episode.

72
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,217
A frequent TV guest star,

77
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:30,348
In it, Elaine asks James if
he wants to get together again.

78
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,094
He replies: ''Uh, I'll call you in the
morning. It's my job. Remember?''

79
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:45,459
The ''quiche thing'' Jerry
mentions here is a ref erence. . .

80
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:49,797
. . .to a 1 982 best-selling book
by Bruce Feirstein called
<i>Real Men Don't Eat Quiche</i>.

81
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:54,431
The book was a satirical guide to
living lif e as a macho manly man.

82
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,908
Feirstein knows what makes
a ''real man.'' He went on to write. . .

83
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,743
. . .three screenplays f or the ultimate
masculine character, James Bond.

84
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:08,178
Elaine originally added grapefruit to
the list of sub-manly f ood choices.

85
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,790
It's not a big surprise that Kramer
pegged George as Mr. Weatherbee.

86
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,095
''The Bee'' shared George's stocky,
bald, bespectacled f eatures. . .

87
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,136
. . .as well as his shorter height.

88
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:08,815
Stacey Travis also has
quite a list of films to her credit.

89
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,976
They include: <i>The Muse</i>,
<i>Traffic</i> and <i>Ghost Worlf</i>.

90
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,831
Thomas Dekker has worked steadily
since his appearance as Bobby
in this episode.

91
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:39,206
Actually, his <i>Seinfelf</i> career
began in season five. . .

92
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,871
. . .when he appeared in
''The Stand-In.''

93
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,714
Since then he's appeared on TV shows
ranging from <i>Star Tre k: Voyager</i>. . .

94
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,880
. . .to <i>Grosse Pointe</i>
and <i>CSI</i> to <i>7 th Heaven</i>.

95
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:55,587

in sound studios. . .

like <i>The Lanf Before Time</i>. . .

97
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,193
. . .and <i>An American Tail</i> series.

98
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,939
Mutton, lamb and hogget
all ref er to sheep meat.

99
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:44,642
The terms have taken on diff erent
meanings in various cultures. . .

100
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,578
. . . but lamb meat typically comes
from young animals. . .

101
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,913
. . .while mutton and hogget
come from older, fattier sheep.

102
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:58,190
Mutton tends to be more flavorful
than lamb and is often used in stews.

103
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:13,830
Julia was scripted to say ''thanks
f or the mutton'' bef ore she exits.

104
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:17,842
She dropped the ''the,''
and a new joke was born.

105
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:22,472
Comedy writers ref er to the last joke
in a sitcom scene as ''the blow.''

106
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:17,564
Brian McNamara (James )
costarred in the NBC sitcom
that bumped <i>Seinfelf</i>. . .

107
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:20,571
. . .to make it on the network's
1 989 calendar, <i>The Nutt House</i>.

108
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,066
For more on <i>Seinfelf</i>'s
unusual start, check out. . .

109
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:27,077
. . .the ''How It Began'' documentary
on Volume 1 of <i>Seinfelf</i> on DVD.

110
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,011
McNamara has worked consistently
on both the big and small screens.

111
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,948
He's played leads in <i>Short Circuit</i>. . .

112
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,851
. . . <i>The Flamingo Kif</i>, <i>Caffyshack II</i>
and <i>Arachnophobia</i>.

113
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:41,054
More recently he's had a recurring
role on Fox's smash hit <i>The O. C</i>.

114
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:45,088
He also guest-starred on an episode
of <i>It's Like</i>, <i>You Know</i>. . .

115
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,631
. . .created by <i>Seinfelf</i> writer
Peter Mehlman.

116
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,540
Foot f etishists have
earmarked this scene. . .

117
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,375
. . .as one of their favorites
of the season.

118
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,967
KL5 is another name f or 555, the
standard prefix f or made-up numbers.

119
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:33,409
This abbreviation is known
as a telephone exchange.

120
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:37,514
Most Americans recited their numbers
using the letter/ number combo. . .

121
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,845
. . .from the 1 930s to the 1 950s.

122
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,845
The practice was quite common
in Manhattan. . .

123
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:45,457
. . .and it seems New Yorker habits
die hard.

124
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,862
In India and other Eastern nations,
the term mutton often ref ers. . .

125
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,371
. . .to goat meat
rather than sheep meat.

126
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,707
Mutton curries are
specialties of Indian cuisine.

127
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:04,864
Paul O'Neill took over first base
from Don Mattingly.

128
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,032
He played f or the Yankees
from 1 993 to 2001 .

129
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,845
A five-time All-Star, f our of his
fingers wear World Series rings.

130
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,756
The actors and crew shot this scene
ahead of the rest of the season. . .

131
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:29,259
. . .on Saturday, August 1 9, 1 995.

132
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:37,303
They did so to take advantage of
a Yankee visit to nearby Anaheim. . .

133
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,632
. . .and utilized
the stadium's locker room.

134
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,040
The Yankees played the Angels
that night, losing 5 to 3.

135
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:49,309
Paul O'Neill played
but went 0 f or 4.

136
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,129
As he did in season six's
''The Chaperone''. . .

137
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,301
. . .Yankee announcer Bob Sheppard
recorded this voiceover.

138
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:32,415
Deleted dialogue reveals that Jerry
was drinking ginger ale in this scene.

139
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,192
Thomas Dekker had roles on
<i>The Young anf the Restless</i>
and <i>Star Tre k: Generations</i>.

140
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,133
He starred in the TV series based on
the film <i>Honey</i>, <i>I Shrunk the Kifs</i>.

141
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,398
He even played young Donny Osmond
in <i>Insife the Osmonfs</i>.

142
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,166
The Yankees didn't play
when this aired.

143
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:52,210
The Mariners won the pennant.
But O'Neill homered in game five.

144
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,312
As many schoolchildren could
tell you, 503 years prior. . .

145
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,814
. . .to the day that this episode aired,
October 1 2, 1 995. . .

146
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:00,681
. . .Christopher Columbus
reached the New World.

147
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,252
On the same day in 1 960,
Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev. . .

148
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:07,791
. . .threw his infamous tantrum
at the United Nations. . .

149
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,690
. . . pounding his shoe on the table.

150
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:13,357
Civil war buffs probably already know
that Conf ederate army commander. . .

151
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,865
. . . Robert E. Lee passed away on
the same day in 1 870.

152
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,128
Now you know too.

153
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:22,501
History off ers a f ew
compelling stories. . .

154
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:25,668
. . .of pro ball players
promising home runs to sick kids.

155
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,775
In 1 926, Babe Ruth promised an ailing
1 1 -year-old, Johnny Sylvester. . .

156
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,714
. . .a home run during an
October World Series game. . .

157
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,877
. . .against the St. Louis Cardinals.

158
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,147
The Bambino smacked not one,
not two, but three homers that day.

159
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:41,225
He even sent one ball soaring out
of the park and right through. . .

160
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,886
. . .the window of a car dealership
behind the stadium.

161
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,822
Film history also off ers
a similar tale.

162
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,161
In the 1 942 biopic
<i>The Prife of the Yankees</i>. . .

163
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,362
. . . Lou Gehrig (played by Gary Cooper)
promises a hospitalized boy. . .

164
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,007
. . .that he'll hit two home runs
in a World Series game.

165
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,601
Gehrig makes good
and little Billy walks again.

166
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,575
Inside-the-park home runs
are rare in the majors.

167
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:07,811
The ball does not clear
the outfield f ence and the batter. . .

168
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:11,321
. . . makes it home without
any errors committed in the field.

169
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:14,724
Major League Baseball
defines an error as f ollows:

170
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:18,854
''An error shall be charged
f or each misplay
( fumble, muff or wild throw ). . .

171
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,694
. . .which prolongs
the time at bat of a batter. . .

172
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,564
. . .or which prolongs
the lif e of a runner. . .

173
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:28,765
. . .or which permits a runner
to advance one or more bases.''

174
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,915
Angioplasty is a medical procedure
in which surgeons. . .

175
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:41,452
. . .open a narrow coronary artery
using a balloon.

176
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:48,059
A stent, or wire-mesh tube,
is placed at the narrowed section. . .

177
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,253
. . .during the procedure.

178
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,957
If timed correctly, angioplasty is
a pref erred treatment. . .

179
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:57,467
. . .f or heart-attack patients.

180
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:16,813
Major League Baseball defines
a catch as ''the act of a fielder. . .

181
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,983
. . .of getting secure possession in
his hand or glove of a ball in flight. . .

182
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:24,892
. . .and firmly holding it, providing he
does not use his cap, protector. . .

183
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:28,398
. . . pocket or any other part of
his unif orm in getting possession.''

184
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:35,404
So the hat catch requested
wouldn't exactly count.

185
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:02,691
This episode winked at NBC audiences
f or the first time at 9 p. m. . .

186
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,269
. . .on Thursday, October 1 2, 1 995.

187
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:11,034
''The Wink'' scored a 22. 3 rating
with a 34 share.

188
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,995
Here's some industry
insider inf o f or you:

189
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:40,166
The scene broadcast over a show's
closing credits is called ''the tag.''

190
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:54,782
The tag f or this episode f eatures
George and Mr. Steinbrenner.

191
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:06,729
Steinbrenner's ramble includes a list
of the many baseball managers. . .

192
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,893
. . . he's fired since becoming
the team owner in 1 972.

193
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:14,532
It ends with a mention
of Buck Showalter. . .

194
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,268
. . .who would be fired on
November 2, 1 995. . .

195
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,436
. . . less than three weeks
after this episode debuted.

196
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,017
Joe Torre replaced Showalter
the next season.

197
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,548
It was a good move.

198
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:32,915
Torre went on to lead the Yanks
to f our World Series titles.
