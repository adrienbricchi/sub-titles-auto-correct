00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:06,743
As veteran viewers will explain to
rookies, this f eature will guide you. . .

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:08,906
. . .through each episode's
many historical, cultural. . .

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,414
. . .and series-related ref erences.

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:12,075
And here's our first fact
of the season:

5
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:14,050
Chess originated
in 6th century India. . .

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,156
. . .although it could date back
to 2nd century China.

7
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,656
''Checkmate'' originates from
the Persian phrase <i>shah mat</i>. . .

8
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:20,020
. . . meaning ''the king is dead.''

9
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:21,718
There are no moves
the player can make. . .

10
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,523
. . .to save the king,
hence the game is over.

11
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,825
We also keep track of each of the
main f our's girlfriends /boyfriends. . .

12

. . . Kramer's entrances
into Jerry's apartment. . .

13
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,767
. . .and every time Jerry says
''Hello, Newman.''

14
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,166
And our first counter:

15
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,671

the Art Department on films
like <i>City Slickers</i> and <i>Chaplin</i>.

19
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:20,611
The word ''emasculated'' derives
from the Latin. . .

20
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:24,781
. . . meaning ''deprived of
male role or identity.''

21
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:30,558

the phrase ''Happy, Pappy?''. . .

28
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,190
Susan became a lesbian and was

29
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,492
. . . late in season f our. . .

30
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,659
. . .in ''The Smelly Car'' episode.

31
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,828
In deleted dialogue. . .

32
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:20,997

KRAMER ENTRANCE COUNTER: #240

43
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,949

44
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,579
In some deleted jokes,
Kramer continued his rant:

45
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:43,781
''And everywhere you go,
you have to call.

46
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,792
'I 'm going to be a little late.'

47
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:51,830
'I 'm sorry, I can 't be
home f or another half-hour.

48
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,766
Is that okay? Can I stay out
another half-hour? Please!'''

49
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:01,705
While the characters shied away
from marriage and family. . .

50
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:07,837
. . .the actors playing them
have taken diff erent routes. . .

51
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,848
. . .in their own lives.

52
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:15,455
As of 2006, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and
husband Brad Hall have two boys.

53
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,887
So do Jason Alexander
and his wif e Daena.

54
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,788
Michael Richards has one daughter.

55
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,192
And Jerry Seinf eld and his wif e
Jessica have three young children.

56
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,592
If this spot looks familiar. . .

57
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:26,995
. . .you must have seen
season five's finale, ''The Opposite.''

58
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,830
This bench is located
on the Santa Monica Pier
above the Pacific Ocean.

59
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,302
<i>Seinfelf</i> crew members played
the couples in this scene.

60
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:34,134
That's 2nd assistant director
Jim Lansbury. . .

61
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:35,775
. . .and script supervisor
Christine Nyhart.

62
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,811
And that's producer Tim Kaiser
with the woman and infant.

63
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,296
Notice Elaine's hoarse voice?

64
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:08,670
Julia's not acting.
She really did lose her voice.

65
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:12,643
It happened while filming
the scenes screaming at the dog. . .

66
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:16,943
. . .which took place the day
bef ore shooting this apartment scene.

67
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,416
Overnight, her voice
became hoarse. . .

68
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,715
. . .so the laryngitis
was written into the script.

69
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,417
Laryngitis is an inflammation
of the voice box or larynx.

70
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,121
It often comes on quickly
and can last up to two weeks.

71
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:33,927
Common causes include overuse
of the voice, as in Julia's case. . .

00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,331
. . .upper respiratory inf ections. . .

00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:18,309
As many of you know,

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,314

92
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,580

93
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:37,850
. . . had taken a bite of his flesh home
as a souvenir.

94
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:46,597
Recognize these memories from
previous seasons?

95
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,099
You shouldn 't.

96
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,899

From this conversation. . .

119
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:39,511
. . .it's clear that George never
introduced Susan to his parents. . .

120
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,116

121

Deleted dialogue reveals that Newman
sings it to get him ''in the mood.''

158
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,302
The ''singing rage'' Patti Page
recorded the song to much acclaim.

159
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,142
Hers is the most famous rendition.

160
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,513
Bob Merrill is also known
f or penning a song. . .

161
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,519
. . .that we bet will make you
think of Barbra Streisand: ''People.''

162
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:52,591
Elaine, Kramer and Newman are
breaking all sorts of New York laws. . .

163
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,784
. . . by lifting this pooch.

164
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,123
For starters, larceny.

165
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,788
They are taking possession
of her neighbor's dog. . .

166
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,958
. . .without authorization

167
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,126
They're also looking at
abandonment charges. . .

168
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,295
. . .f or leaving the dog
on a stranger's doorstep.

169
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:09,306
That's a misdemeanor
in New York. . .

170
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:13,674
. . .and they could face a year
in the slammer and / or a $1 , 000 fine.

171
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:21,049
In the shooting script. . .

172
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:25,214
. . . Kramer explains that Newman
wouldn 't take money. . .

173
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:29,385
. . .to kidnap the dog because
''it's the hate that drives him.''

174
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:48,547
The names of real movie stars
Glenn Close and Sally Field. . .

175
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:52,412
. . . lend credence to another fake
movie name, <i>The Mutef Heart</i>.

176
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,902
Timepieces became portable
in the 1 5th century. . .

Originally the accessory
was made just f or women. . .

181
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:28,751
. . . but by World War I ,
the trend caught on with men. . .

182
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:33,256
. . . namely soldiers in the field.

183
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,760
Kramer may tell time
by the sun here. . .

184
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,764
. . . but by the eighth season, he seems
to be carrying a pocket watch.

185
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,870
In fact, he sets that watch
an hour ahead in ''The Susie.''

186
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,769
It seems the dog that has been
haunting Elaine is a silky terrier.
