A rabbi is the title
f or a spiritual Jewish leader.

00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,822
Some insight into
Elaine's neighbor was cut.

2
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,657
Elaine was scripted to say,
''Very nice man. . .

3
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:25,560
. . .although not the world's
greatest dresser.''

4
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,566
Jerry then said, ''Rabbis generally
aren't on the cutting edge of fashion.''

5
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:31,603
Elaine replied, ''It's 80 degrees out,
he's walking around with a wool suit.''

6
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,401
The ''dog'' is a ref erence to the
previous episode, ''The Engagement.''

7
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,409
As in earlier years...

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,083
That's when they decided
to have George get engaged.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,104
Larry David wrote the opening
three episodes of the season. . .

13
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,107
. . .to help set the tone
f or the storylines that would f ollow.

00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,543
. . .in his return appearances
in season nine.

26
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:55,392
Jerry's odd delivery of this line is
an homage to comedian Jackie Mason.

27
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,671
March 21 is the spring,
or vernal equinox.

28
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,774
It marks the moment when the sun
crosses the celestial equator. . .

. . .as both a writer and actor
on <i>Frifays</i>.

40
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,884
It's no surprise that Larry David
selected his old colleague. . .

41
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,887
. . .to play the rabbi.

42
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,892
David and Mahler prayed together
during their years on <i>Frifays</i>...

43
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,897

The word rabbi translates
from Hebrew as ''teacher'' or ''master.''

46
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,138
Rabbis train f or years,

Caf é lattes are made with a single
shot of espresso and steamed milk.

50
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,882
The ratio is three parts milk
to one part coff ee.

51
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,918
Notice the way Michael Richards
says ''caf é latte.''

52
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,612
His mispronunciations
of certain words. . .

53
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,519
. . .often had the rest of the cast
in stitches.

54
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:47,320
To this day, only Michael knows
if it was an actor's choice. . .

55
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,019
. . .or just his way of speaking.

''The Chinese Restaurant.''

59
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,634

There are 25, 000 wire-mesh
litter baskets in New York City.

The Lauers are the names
of real friends of Larry David.

67
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:44,782
The next coff ee shop scene
originally opened. . .

68
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:48,854
. . .with Jerry returning from
the bathroom.

69
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,919
Jerry says the door should be lowered
to the floor unless it's f or ventilation.

70
00:10:57,097 --> 00:11:02,933
George replies, ''I'd take privacy
over ventilation any day.''

71
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:06,163
To which Jerry opines:

72
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,207
''That, my friend,
is a very personal choice. . .

73
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:13,574
. . .the need f or privacy versus
the need f or ventilation.

74
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:19,879
Those are the two greatest needs that
a human being has in a bathroom.''

75
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:59,323
More cut dialogue had Jerry
and George discussing the fact. . .

76
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:03,327
. . .that women are much more
comf ortable crying than men.

77
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:07,160
Jerry: ''They go to movies sometimes
specifically to cry.

78
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:11,828
Sometimes it'll be advertised.
'It's a good crying movie.'

79
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:15,169
And they go, 'Let's go.'

80
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:19,176
They bring their handkerchief,
they love it.''

81
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:23,180
George then says, ''It's too bad
they're not like babies. . .

82
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,343
. . .where you make funny faces
and they stop.''

83
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,593
George faces the possibility
of make-up sex in ''The Sponge.''

84
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,043
And conjugal-visit sex takes on
a whole new meaning f or George. . .

85
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:57,445
. . .when he dates a prisoner
in season eight's ''The Little Jerry.''

00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:50,295
Moses was the first rabbi.

91
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:58,576
The process of rabbinic ordination
is known as semicha.

92
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:05,583
Once ordained, a rabbi is authorized
to advise and give judgments...

93
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:10,850
. . . based on his or her understanding
of Jewish law.

94
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,524
We tell you this
so you'll understand why. . .

95
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:18,927
. . .some viewers
f ound it necessary. . .

96
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,830
. . .to write letters complaining
about <i>Seinfelf</i>'s portrayal. . .

97
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:26,200
. . .of the gossiping rabbi.

98
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:08,535
The script shows that Jerry
had come to Elaine's apartment. . .

99
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:14,739
. . . because she was coming along
to see <i>Plan 9</i>.

100
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:18,612
After explaining
the rabbi 's actions. . .

101
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:23,085
. . . Jerry then says that the rabbi
was so interesting. . .

102
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:27,091
. . . he's thinking of joining
his temple.

103
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:32,927
Elaine then bags the movie because
she no longer f eels like going.

104
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:32,356
Kasha varnishkas is a Jewish dish
made from raw buckwheat. . .

105
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:39,022
. . .and thick bowtie egg noodles
cooked with onions and butter.

106
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,866
In a memorable scene
from season six's ''The Doorman''. . .

107
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:45,869
. . . Frank Costanza climbs into bed
with his son and a bowl of kasha.

108
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,872
That scene also provided
some of the series' best bloopers.

109
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,875
The original script opened
with the rabbi on the phone saying:

110
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,344
''No, I never said that. Yes, I did say
the part about having sex in the car.

111
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,642
But I never mentioned
stealing the CD.

112
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,048
I don't know where
you got that from.''

113
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,485
The scene ends with Elaine
pleading with him. . .

114
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:06,626
. . . not to mention
what she told him. . .

115
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,626
. . .about illegally deducting
her apartment rent as an office. . .

116
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,320
. . .on her tax return.

117
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,523
The rabbi replies,
''Well, here's the thing. . .

118
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,794
. . .it just so happens an old friend
of mine works f or the IRS.''

119
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,029
Elaine then buries her face
in her hands.

120
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:32,408
Note the fine acting job
of the pained woman next to Kramer.

121
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,214
It's not acting.

122
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,684
She really was hurt
during this scene.

123
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,921
Of course, this was the funniest take
so her anguish was immortalized.

124
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:46,930
Kelly Perine (usher) played ''Reggie''
on <i>Provifence</i>. . .

125
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,933
. . .and ''Chuck'' on
<i>The Drew Carey Show</i>.

KRAMER ENTRANCE COUNTER: #243

00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:06,697
This storyline parodies

. . .''hot coff ee'' case of 1 992.

129
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,742
A 7 9-year-old retiree,
Stella Liebeck. . .

130
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,208
. . . had third-degree burns when
hot coff ee spilled in her lap.

131
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,904
After eight days in the hospital,
she sued McDonald's® f or damages.

132
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,879
The story made headlines after a jury
awarded the plaintiff $2.7 million.

133
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:19,916
During appeals,
the case was settled out of court.

134
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,020
It is unlikely she settled
f or free coff ee f or lif e.

135
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,749
McDonald's® typically serves its coff ee
between 1 80° F and 1 90° F.

136
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,189
The coff ee from the location
in question was only 1 58° F.

137
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,851
Home brewers typically heat their joe
between 1 35 ° and 1 40° F.

138
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:36,299
''The Postponement'' premiered on NBC
on September 28, 1 995.

139
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:39,768
It scored a 22.7 rating and a 35 share.

140
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,773
Bef ore we go,
here's a little more coff ee trivia:

141
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:46,174
More than 500 billion cups of coff ee
are guzzled each year.

142
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,179
Did you know that Scandinavia
holds the record. . .

143
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,182
. . .f or highest per capita coff ee
consumption in the world?

00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,879
Finnish people

145
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:59,048
Over half of adult Americans drink
