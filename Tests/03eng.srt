0
00:00:02,176 --> 00:00:04,235
l've never been any place
there was no coffee.

1
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:07,804
And people constantly try
to give you coffee.

2
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:10,974
''Who's having coffee?
Can l get you some coffee?''

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,245
Coffee's one of the only things
you can have...

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:16,015
...that people continue
to try and give it to you.

5
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:19,556
Waitresses ask, ''Can l fill it up?
Can l warm it up? Can l top it off?''

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:21,251
You could lift up a manhole cover:

7
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,954
''We just made a fresh pot.
Would you like some?''

8
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,930
lt has taken over humanity.

9
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:31,367
There are coffee machines
we have to call ''mister.''

10
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:38,505
''Coffee anyone?''
''Hey, that's Mr. Coffee to you.''

11
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,818
Then l hear this rabbi on television.
l mean, imagine.

12
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,219
l'm really sorry, George.

13
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:54,521
l wasn't jealous of you.
lt was just the whole marriage thing.

14
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,493
You know, l was just
a little surprised.

15
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:59,428
Why would anyone eat canned fruit?

16
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,035
l mean, can anybody answer that?

17
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:05,502
-What about all the ''loser'' stuff?
-l don't know where the rabbi got that.

18
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:10,838
You know, l never said that.
l said, ''l've never seen you looser.''

19
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,840
l could see the can
if you're in the Army.

20
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,950
But fresh fruit, it's available.
lt's there.

21
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,109
lt's two aisles over.

22
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,290
Well, scintillating as always.

23
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,120
-Where you going?
-l'm going shopping with Susan.

24
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,489
-What kind of shopping?
-Clothes shopping.

25
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,358
-Where you going?
-Ross'.

26
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,499
-That's a nice store.
-lt's her uncle's.

27
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:35,759
-Discount?
-One would hope.

28
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,901
So my friend and l,
we were going to the movies...

29
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,635
...and we stopped off
and bought this café latte.

30
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,836
-ls that ltalian coffee?
-Yeah, that's right.

31
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:48,209
-Half milk, half coffee?
-Yeah.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,580
-You take a sip?
-Yes, l did.

33
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,482
When you did,
did you notice it was hot?

34
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,384
Could you sip it
in your normal fashion?

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,486
No, l wasn't able to sip it
in my normal fashion.

36
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,624
All right, all right.

37
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,423
You take big sips?

38
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,860
Well, l think l take a normal sip.

39
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,661
Okay, you take normal sips.
Nothing wrong with that.

40
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:10,429
-Then what happened?
-Well, you know...

41
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,938
...they don't allow outside drinks
in the movie theater...

42
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:16,338
...so l had to put it in my shirt
and sneak it in.

43
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,945
Yeah, see, they like
to sell their own coffee.

44
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,411
-ls that gonna be a problem?
-Yeah, it's a problem.

45
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:22,981
lt'll be a problem for them.

46
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,449
lt's a clear violation of
your rights as a consumer.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,611
An infringement
on your constitutional rights.

48
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,724
lt's outrageous,
egregious, preposterous.

49
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,251
lt's definitely preposterous.

50
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,089
So then what happened?

51
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:39,859
Well, l was trying to get to my seat,
and l had to step over someone...

52
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,366
...and l kind of got pushed,
and it spilled on me.

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,698
-Was there a top on it?
-Yeah.

54
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,432
Did you put the top on,
or did they put it on for you?

55
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,974
-They put the top on.
-And they made the top.

56
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:52,203
You didn't make the top, did you?

57
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,278
Suzy, l want you to go down
to Java World.

58
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:00,046
Get me a café latte with a top.

59
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,212
We're gonna run
some tests on that top.

60
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,453
-Have you been to the doctor?
-No. No, l haven't.

61
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,052
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.

62
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,926
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.
Tell him it's for me.

63
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,160
-So, what do you think, Mr. Chiles?
-Jackie.

64
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,301
-Jackie. l mean, we got a chance?
-Do we have a chance?

65
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:21,271
Get me one coffee-drinker
on that jury...

66
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,273
...you gonna walk out of there
a rich man.

67
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,747
l don't like it. lt's red.
lt's too flashy.

68
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,908
Well, you could use a little flash.

69
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,450
All right, don't change me.
Susan, don't change me.

70
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:39,423
There's a lot of women that would love
to be in your position right now.

71
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:41,921
Name one.

72
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,757
So did you find anything?

73
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,332
Oh, he is impossible
to shop for, Uncle Ned.

74
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,295
l'm going on vacation to Costa Rica.

75
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,268
Maybe l'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,635
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.

77
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,479
-See, now, this l don't get.
-What?

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,944
-The security guard.
-What about him?

79
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,749
Why does he have to stand?

80
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,480
Because he's a security guard.

81
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:08,986
l mean, look at him.

82
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:12,126
He's gotta be on his feet like that
all day? l mean, that's brutal.

83
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,228
-l'm gonna say something to your uncle.
-George, you just met him.

84
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:17,387
Don't say anything to him.

85
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,999
Aren't you concerned
about the security guard?

86
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,629
Not really.

87
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,864
<i>She's not concerned</i>
<i>about the security guard.</i>

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,268
<i>What kind of person is this?</i>

89
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,440
<i>I'm marrying a person</i>
<i>who doesn't care...</i>

90
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,601
<i>...this man has to stand</i>
<i>eight hours a day...</i>

91
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,303
<i>...when he could easily</i>
<i>be sitting.</i>

92
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,075
All right, George.
What do you think?

93
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:42,014
-So, what did you do last night?
-Nothing.

94
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,919
l know, but what did you
actually do?

95
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:48,255
Literally nothing.
l sat in a chair and l stared.

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,663
-Wow, that really is nothing.
-l told you.

97
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,661
-Hey.
-Hey.

98
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,063
What are you dressed up for?

99
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:58,000
l just came from a meeting
with my lawyer.

100
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,504
-How's that looking?
-l'll tell you how it's looking.

101
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,337
My lawyer says if there's
one coffee-drinker on that jury...

102
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,445
...l'm gonna be a rich man.

103
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh, that's despicable.

104
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,776
How does he know
how all coffee-drinkers will vote?

105
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:14,513
l'm a coffee-drinker. lf l was on
that jury, l wouldn't give you a nickel.

106
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,489
Well, you wouldn't be on that jury.
He would've weeded you out.

107
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,529
Frankly, l'm surprised
you're so litigious.

108
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,029
Oh, l can be quite litigious.

109
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,496
Whoever heard of this anyway?

110
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,693
Suing a company
because their coffee is too hot?

111
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,274
-Coffee is supposed to be hot.
-But Jackie says the top was faulty.

112
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:37,468
Jackie says the top was faulty.

113
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,904
-Hey, Maestro.
-Kramer.

114
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,812
-l'm in here. How's it going?
-Fine.

115
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,748
Hi, Bob.

116
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:50,082
l'm sorry. Maestro.

117
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,055
Oh, boy. This is a surprise.
Look at you.

118
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,094
l just wanted to drop off
this Chinese balm for your burns.

119
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:59,062
lt's supposed to be great stuff.
lt's all herbal.

120
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,294
Oh, Maestro, what are you doing?
You don't have to do this.

121
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,769
-Do you believe this Maestro?
-lt's nothing.

122
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,965
You know, you haven't
been around for a while.

123
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:10,007
Oh, yeah. l've been
at my house in Tuscany.

124
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:13,112
Tuscany, huh? You hear that, Jerry?
That's in ltaly. Yeah.

125
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:14,776
l hear it's beautiful there.

126
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,180
Well, if you're thinking
of getting a place there, don't bother.

127
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,752
There's really nothing available.

128
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,520
-Hello.
-Well, hello.

129
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,855
-And who might you be?
-l might be Elaine.

130
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,122
-This is Bob Cobb.
-Maestro.

131
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,194
-Maestro?
-lt is my very great pleasure.

132
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,971
-l have to get going.
-l have to be going.

133
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:43,269
Jinx. Buy me a Coke.

134
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,811
-l love it when that happens.
-l know, l know. That is so....

135
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:48,915
-Coincidental.
-Yeah.

136
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,914
-Okay, bye, you guys.
-Yeah, yeah.

137
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,882
-<i>Ciao.</i>
-Yeah, see you. Oh, hey.

138
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:56,455
Thanks for the balm. Yeah.

139
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,356
You know
you hurt the Maestro's feelings.

140
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:07,262
-Because l didn't call him Maestro?
-That's right.

141
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,801
l feel a little funny
calling somebody Maestro.

142
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,462
-Why?
-lt's a stupid thing to be called.

143
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,699
-Jerry, he's a conductor.
-Oh, conductor?

144
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,709
He conducts the Policemen's
Benevolent Association Orchestra.

145
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,744
Well, he's still a conductor.

146
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,815
He sure worked
pretty fast with Elaine.

147
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,384
You should see him do
''Flight of the Bumblebee.''

148
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:27,487
He just....

149
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,948
New shirt?

150
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:33,853
-Yeah, you like it?
-No. Not particularly.

151
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,586
-Why? The color?
-Yeah.

152
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:38,323
-Too flashy?
-Yeah, it's burning my retina.

153
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,166
Susan picked that out
for you, right?

154
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,827
No.

155
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,174
All right, what's it gonna be here?

156
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,833
Let me ask you something.

157
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,003
When you're in a store,
does it bother you...

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,876
...that they make the security guard
stand there all day?

159
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,412
No.

160
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,821
See, it didn't bother Susan either.

161
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,455
That's why l'm different.

162
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:05,615
l can sense
the slightest human suffering.

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
Are you sensing anything
right now?

164
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,328
Let me just say this.

165
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:16,834
lt's inhumane to make a man stand
on his feet...

166
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,995
...in one spot for eight hours a day.

167
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,107
Why shouldn't he have a chair?

168
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,208
What about criminal activity?
He's gotta be alert.

169
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,903
He can't jump out of the chair?
How long does that take?

170
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:30,050
Look at this. Here, watch.
Criminals. Boom, l'm up.

171
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,651
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

172
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,054
Maybe they offered him a chair
and he turned it down.

173
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,748
Would you get out of here.
Who's gonna turn down a chair?

174
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:41,759
l'd be very interested to know
how he felt about all this.

175
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,329
-Maybe l'll have a talk with him.
-l know you will.

176
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,489
Hey, hey. Listen to this.

177
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,396
-Jackie just called.
-Who?

178
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,366
-His lawyer.
-Java World wants to settle.

179
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,130
-What?
-Yeah, l'm gonna be rich.

180
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:55,808
-Why are they settling?
-They're afraid of bad publicity.

181
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,103
All this because
you spilled coffee on yourself?

182
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,372
Yeah, that's right.

183
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,249
l'm gonna need a coffee here!
Very hot! Boiling!

184
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,713
And then, about four years ago...

185
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,191
...l was on holiday in Tuscany,
and l fell in love with this house.

186
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,158
Are you ready to order?

187
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,521
Gosh, what are you getting, Bob?

188
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,936
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.

189
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,971
Thanks.

190
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:31,304
You know, l'm sorry, but....

191
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:37,145
l didn't mention it earlier, but,
actually, l prefer to be called Maestro.

192
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:42,511
-Excuse me?
-Well, you know, l am a conductor.

193
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,448
Yeah. So?

194
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,288
l suppose it's okay for Leonard
Bernstein to be called Maestro...

195
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,828
...because he conducted
the New York Philharmonic.

196
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:53,523
So he gets to be called Maestro
and l don't.

197
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:59,867
Well, don't you think
that he was probably called Maestro...

198
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,873
...while he was conducting.
Not in social situations.

199
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,307
l mean, his friends
probably just called him Lenny.

200
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:10,178
l happen to know for a fact that he was
called Maestro in social situations.

201
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,376
l once saw him in a bar,
and somebody said:

202
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:16,489
''Hello, Maestro, how about a beer?''
Okay? So that's a fact.

203
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,986
Maestro, huh?

204
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,724
Okay.

205
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,688
Maestro.

206
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,676
Jerry! Jerry!

207
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,448
Jerry, my burn, it's gone, look.

208
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,345
-What do you mean?
-l put that Chinese balm on it.

209
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,578
-Look, it healed it.
-So?

210
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,349
So my lawsuit. l'm finished.

211
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,721
-l thought they wanted to settle.
-What happens if they wanna see it?

212
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,860
-Then you're in a lot of trouble.
-Yeah!

213
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:19,585
-Tired?
-No.

214
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,083
How come no chair?

215
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,616
What?

216
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,887
l couldn't help but notice
that you don't have a chair.

217
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,657
-l don't need a chair.
-l didn't mean to imply you did.

218
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,824
You're obviously
a very well-proportioned individual.

219
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,704
What l was just wondering is...

220
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,331
...have they ever
offered you a chair?

221
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,305
-No.
-Would you like a chair?

222
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,605
l suppose if they gave me one
l'd sit down.

223
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,809
You would, wouldn't you?

224
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,679
Obviously l'd rather sit,
if that's what you're asking.

225
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,945
-That's exactly my point.
-Who wouldn't?

226
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,283
Because, l tell you, frankly...

227
00:11:56,457 --> 00:12:00,223
...l'd like to walk in here one day
and find you sitting down.

228
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,386
That would give me
a lot of pleasure.

229
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:05,128
Call me crazy.

230
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,867
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

231
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:12,335
l didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

232
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,133
You haven't even been
to the doctor.

233
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:16,299
Let a doctor put a balm on.

234
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:20,308
-l guess l screwed up, huh, Jackie?
-You're damn right, you screwed up.

235
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,176
Where'd you get
that damn balm anyway?

236
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:24,180
-The Maestro.
-The who?

237
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,945
-What you talking about, Maestro?
-My friend's a conductor.

238
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:30,284
So a maestro tells you
to put a balm on, and you do it?

239
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:32,186
Well, my stomach was burning.

240
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,793
l'll tell you what this is.
lt's a public humiliation.

241
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,363
-l didn't know the balm would work.
-Do you know what a balm is?

242
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,399
You ever seen a balm?
Didn't you read the instructions?

243
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:45,163
No one can tell what a balm's
gonna do. They're unpredictable.

244
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,571
All right, l'm sorry, Jackie.

245
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,372
-Pull over here, driver. This is it.
-Yeah, get over.

246
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,979
-You have a good time?
-Yeah, he's very interesting.

247
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,846
Did you know that Mozart died
while writing the ''Requiem''?

248
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,954
Yeah. Everyone knows that.
lt was in <i>Amadeus</i>.

249
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:03,589
Really?

250
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,191
What about the name?
Did he make you call him Maestro?

251
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,521
-Yeah, l called him Maestro.
-You didn't mind?

252
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,492
Well, l did at first,
but, actually, l kind of got used to it.

253
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,226
Okay, from now on, l want you
to call me Jerry the Great.

254
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:18,462
-l'm not calling you Jerry the Great.
-Why not? You call him Maestro.

255
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,607
-He is a maestro.
-Well, l'm great.

256
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:22,969
So you say.

257
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,737
What about his house in Tuscany?
He mention that?

258
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:28,108
Yeah. l'm invited.

259
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:31,945
When l told him it was beautiful there,
out of the clear blue sky, he says:

260
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,452
''There's nothing to rent,'' as if
he doesn't want anyone else there.

261
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:36,850
Why?

262
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,821
Maybe he's embarrassed
by Americans.

263
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,187
Well, maybe there aren't
any houses to rent there.

264
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,956
ln all of Tuscany? l wonder.

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,431
l say we offer him $50,000, that's it.
Take it or leave it.

266
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:51,901
How do we know
how severe the burns are?

267
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,733
Let's have him
examined by a doctor.

268
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,341
Listen, the faster
we dispose of this, the better.

269
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,603
This thing gets into the paper,
it'll kill us.

270
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,078
All right, we'll start with 50,000
and free coffee at all of our stores.

271
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:07,753
-Yes?
-<i>Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.</i>

272
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,548
Send them in.

273
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,318
Gentlemen.

274
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:18,328
Gentlemen, come in.

275
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,993
Now, we don't want to take up
much of your time.

276
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,900
Let's make this short and sweet.

277
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:30,868
We're prepared to offer you
all the free coffee you want...

278
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:34,241
...at any of our stores throughout
North America and Europe, plus--

279
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,315
l'll take it!

280
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:47,959
''l'll take it''? ''l'll take it''?
Who told you to take it?

281
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,618
-Did l tell you to take it?
-No.

282
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,958
The Maestro didn't tell you to.
He wasn't there.

283
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,657
-We were lucky to get anything.
-Free coffee?

284
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,666
-Yeah.
-l don't want free coffee.

285
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,964
lt's not hard to get coffee.
l can get it myself.

286
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,039
l wanna know
what came after that ''plus.''

287
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,335
l didn't hear any ''plus.''

288
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,138
Twenty years, l've never experienced
anything like this.

289
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:08,747
Look, Java World.
Hey, listen, l'm getting out here.

290
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,817
l'm gonna get myself
a free café latte.

291
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,789
Hey.

292
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,692
Hi, Maestro.

293
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:35,264
-''Beethoven's 7th.''
-Yeah.

294
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,342
-We were just talking about you.
-Oh, yeah?

295
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,639
The other day, you mentioned
there were no houses in Tuscany.

296
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,406
You didn't find one, did you?

297
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,485
-No. Not really looking.
-Nor should you.

298
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:50,521
But are you telling me there's not
one house to rent in all of Tuscany?

299
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,592
The houses are passed down
from generation to generation.

300
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,523
lt's very hard.

301
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:59,757
l can't get a sublet,
a guest room, a cot, nothing?

302
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:03,960
-lt's booked solid.
-lt's booked, Jerry.

303
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,002
-How'd you get yours?
-Got lucky.

304
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:10,337
Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride.
l was about to pop in some Verdi.

305
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:21,284
Maybe l'll check out France.

306
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,088
Hey, George.
Hey, you believe this guy?

307
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,124
-Who?
-Bob Cobb.

308
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:31,128
-Bob Cobb?
-You know, the Maestro.

309
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:32,287
l missed the Maestro?

310
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:36,300
Get this, he tells me there are no
houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.

311
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:41,073
-You renting a house in Tuscany?
-No.

312
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,772
So, what do you care?

313
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,813
l wish l could figure out if this guy's
trying to keep me out of Tuscany.

314
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:55,352
Of course he is. There's got
to be houses for rent in Tuscany.

315
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,956
-Do you know how big Tuscany is?
-l have no idea.

316
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,753
lt's huge.
lt's probably like North Dakota.

317
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:04,091
-Oh, no way it's that big.
-lt's a big region.

318
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,323
You know how big
North Dakota is, stupid?

319
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:11,099
-Why do l bother talking to you?
-There's no gun to your head.

320
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,761
All right.

321
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,666
-So l spoke to the security guard.
-Yeah? And?

322
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,368
lt was tough to get a good read...

323
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,879
...but l think if l brought him
a chair, he'd sit.

324
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,515
-So you're gonna get him a chair?
-Yeah. lt's a question of what kind.

325
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,212
-Thinking about a barstool.
-That'd give him some height.

326
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:32,017
Be able to check things out.
With a back or without?

327
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:33,454
l think l'd go for the back.

328
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,788
-Swivel?
-l suppose he could swivel.

329
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,328
-Maybe one of those director's chairs.
-That's kind of a pompous look.

330
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,769
My parents had a kitchen chair
that would've been perfect.

331
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,373
-One of those vinyl things?
-Yes.

332
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,601
Vinyl, yeah. Maybe.

333
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:55,640
How can l figure out if there's
any places to rent in Tuscany?

334
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:58,780
Wait a minute.
Poppie's from Tuscany.

335
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,381
-l'm gonna go call him.
-Yeah, good luck.

336
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,357
Hey, l'll meet you outside.

337
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:19,561
Poppie told me to talk to his cousin.
He lives down in Little ltaly.

338
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,674
What do you think
about a rocking chair?

339
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,276
You can't limit my café lattes.
lt says so right here.

340
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:27,777
And no dirty looks. lf l want
a café latte, you give me a café latte.

341
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,280
lf l have any problems,
l'll get my lawyer down here.

342
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,815
You'll be in big trouble.

343
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,180
Hey, hey, slow down, Eddie.
What's the matter?

344
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,789
They're making faces
because l've had some café lattes.

345
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,155
But l can have as many café lattes
as l want. That was the settlement.

346
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,694
-That's it?
-That's it. You want one, George?

347
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:46,492
Jerry, you want one?
They're delicious. My pleasure.

348
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,034
You've got to stop it.
You're all hopped up on the caffeine.

349
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,229
-l feel like l'm talking a little faster.
-You're racing.

350
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,398
Well, l got things to do.
See you later. Bye.

351
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:07,976
Oh, Bob.

352
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,679
Bob.

353
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,655
Maestro.

354
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,721
Maestro.

355
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,032
Excuse me. Can l help you?

356
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,934
No. Just giving a chair
to the security guard.

357
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,041
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?

358
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:36,477
-What's your name?
-Evan Fane.

359
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,743
l'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece.

360
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,012
l'll be taking over this whole
place someday...

361
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,315
...so if l were you,
l'd stay on my good side.

362
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,484
l'm terribly sorry. l didn't know.

363
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,524
lnnocent mistake.

364
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:53,891
Well, here you go.
What do you think?

365
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:55,725
Mr. Ross said this was okay?

366
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:58,097
l'm his nephew, all right?
Don't worry about it.

367
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,262
Go ahead. Check it out.

368
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,237
Well....

369
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,080
Not bad.

370
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,687
Not bad at all.

371
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,362
Excuse me,
l'm looking for a Mr. Ciccio.

372
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,794
l'm Ciccio.

373
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,202
Poppie sent me
to see you, Mr. Ciccio.

374
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,802
<i>Sì, sì</i>, Poppie.

375
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,736
Did he mention to you why l called?

376
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,937
-The house in <i>Toscana</i>.
-Yeah, right, right.

377
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,840
So is there anything there to rent?

378
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,312
Two million lire.
You give me the check.

379
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:47,817
-No, l didn't actually want to rent it.
-The keys. Here are the keys.

380
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:51,014
You give me the check.
Two million lire.

381
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:54,786
Seventeen-hundred American.

382
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,436
No, see...

383
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,570
...l didn't say that l wanted to rent it.

384
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:14,578
l was just wondering
if there were houses there to rent.

385
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,846
This one.

386
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:53,584
lt's been a rough couple of weeks.
l really needed to get away.

387
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:55,414
l told you.

388
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:57,386
lt's paradise.

389
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,185
You were right, Maestro.

390
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,470
Come on, Jerry, this guy's crazy.
Get out.

391
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,405
l'm getting out.
You didn't have to push me.

392
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,946
-How much did you pay that guy?
-Seventy-five thousand lire.

393
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,709
Seventy-five thousand lire?
Are you out of your mind?

394
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,012
Kramer, you don't understand
the conversion rate.

395
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:28,381
The conversion rates.

396
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,615
-l don't even know why l brought you.
-Nobody put a gun to your head.

397
00:22:36,162 --> 00:22:37,390
-Not bad.
-Yeah.
