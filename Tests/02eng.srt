00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,508
-Hey.
-Hey.

1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,349
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.

2
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:17,513
Really? What happened?

3
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,683
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building--

4
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,829
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.

5
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:24,965
-ls he the one with the show on cable?
-Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

6
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,534
So l spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...

7
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:31,263
...and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,999
-That's great.
-l know.

9
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,086
-That looks pretty good.
-He's in.

10
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:58,325
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.

11
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:01,696
-What's to discuss?
-Come on. George is getting married.

12
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,097
ls he happy?

13
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:06,563
l will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.

14
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:10,507
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?

15
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:13,511
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.

16
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,646
lsn't that why we have locks
on the doors?

17
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:18,718
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...

18
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,683
...you can see if it's taken.

19
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,016
A backup system?

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,059
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...

21
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:29,253
...in anticipation
of the locks not working?

22
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:33,656
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.

23
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,803
Can we change the subject, please?

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,302
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?

25
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,670
No, fine. lf you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.

26
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,167
lt's not that l wanna keep
talking about it.

27
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:47,678
l just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.

28
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,750
Well, l didn't think
that it had any momentum.

29
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:54,214
<i>How am I gonna do this?</i>

30
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,881
<i>I'm engaged to this woman?</i>
<i>She doesn't even like me.</i>

31
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,153
<i>Change the subject?</i>
<i>Toilets were the subject.</i>

32
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,025
<i>We don't even share</i>
<i>the same interests.</i>

33
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,602
-Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
-Well, that's all that counts, l guess.

34
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:15,908
What's the matter?

35
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:18,170
What? Nothing.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,708
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.

37
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,646
Well, what do you want me to do?

38
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:27,446
l thought you'd have
some reaction to it.

39
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,787
Well, l don't.

40
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,357
l think maybe you're a little jealous.

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,431
Oh, what, you think
l wanna marry George?

42
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,898
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.

43
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,198
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that l want.

44
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,466
Oh, yeah. Right.

45
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,132
Yeah, right.

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,711
-Laney.
-Jerry.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,075
-You don't wanna get married?
-Yeah, that's right.

48
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,080
-l don't wanna get married.
-Oh, come on.

49
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,912
-Oh, you come on.
-lt's such--

50
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,145
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

51
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:03,722
Hey, Elaine, listen, l was talking
to a friend about this dog business.

52
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:07,725
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?

53
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,328
Are you aware of this?

54
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,958
-Oh, dear.
-lt can never be erased.

55
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,296
lt'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.

56
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,600
l'll never be able to get a job.
l mean, doesn't that concern you?

57
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:22,774
Everything l've worked for,
down the drain...

58
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,673
...because of one stupid mistake.

59
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,747
l mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?

60
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,712
-We gotta change the system.
-Yes!

61
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,909
l could care less.

62
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:35,481
l hope it is on our record.
l'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.

63
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,933
-Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
-Elaine.

64
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,934
Always a pleasure to see you.

65
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:54,134
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.

66
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:58,301
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...

67
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,471
...and just as often
there are solutions.

68
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:03,774
Yeah, yeah, l suppose.

69
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:09,389
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if l may say, troubled.

70
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,282
No, Rabbi, l'm not myself.

71
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:16,330
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.

72
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,828
Hey.

73
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,866
l want your honest opinion
about something.

74
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:25,062
-Have l ever been less than forthright?
-No, you haven't.

75
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,673
Well, maybe you have.
What do l know?

76
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:30,640
l probably have. Of course l have.
What am l talking about?

77
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,043
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea:

78
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:38,174
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...

79
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,580
...all the way to the floor.

80
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:45,516
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?

81
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,991
Door comes down,
hides your feet.

82
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,859
-Yes, l like it. l like it a lot.
-lt's good, right?

83
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,900
l think it's fantastic.
l think it's a fantastic idea.

84
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,400
-You do?
-Yes, l do.

85
00:04:56,571 --> 00:05:00,007
Well, l told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.

86
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,006
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me:

87
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,542
''Can we change the subject?''

88
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,646
-See, now, that l don't care for.
-Right.

89
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,408
l mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?

90
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,609
lt should resolve of its own volition.

91
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,380
That's exactly what l said,
but l used the word ''momentum.''

92
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,388
-''Momentum,'' same thing.
-Same thing.

93
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,852
My God, l'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?

94
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,853
Yeah, l know.

95
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,555
How am l gonna make December?
l need a little more time.

96
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,200
Look at me,
l'm a nervous wreck.

97
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,768
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. l can't turn.

98
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:32,132
Look, look.

99
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,469
-You're turning.
-No, that's not a good turn.

100
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:37,770
December! December!

101
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:41,312
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?

102
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,143
lf you need more time,
you should have more time.

103
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,454
-What, you think l could postpone it?
-Sure you can. Why not?

104
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,614
-You're allowed to postpone?
-l don't see why not.

105
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,824
-So l could do that?
-Sure, go ahead.

106
00:05:56,797 --> 00:06:00,255
All right. All right.

107
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,698
l'll tell you what, how about this?
l got the date.

108
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,236
March 2 1 st, the first day of spring.

109
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,000
-Spring, of course.
-You know, spring.

110
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:11,144
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.

111
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,212
All that crap.

112
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:15,982
Beautiful.

113
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:19,448
-She's not gonna like it.
-No, she's not.

114
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,316
You know, l think
l'm a little bit scared of her.

115
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:27,185
She's 5'3'', like 1 00 pounds,
l'm frightened to death of her.

116
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:31,492
Well, she's a women.
They don't like to be disappointed.

117
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,463
Especially her.

118
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,228
She does not like disappointment.

119
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:38,827
Well, l have to do it.

120
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:41,201
l can't make December.
No way l can make December.

121
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,366
You can see that, right?
l mean, look at me.

122
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:47,344
Can l make December? l can't
make December, right? Look! Look!

123
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:50,245
-Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
-March 2 1 st.

124
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,613
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?

125
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,688
-Oh, all the way.
-You are a good friend.

126
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:58,882
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, l wouldn't turn you in.

127
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,053
ls that so?

128
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,631
Hey, Kramer, if l killed somebody,
would you turn me in?

129
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,268
Definitely.

130
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,697
-You're kidding.
-No, no, l would turn you in.

131
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:18,044
-You would turn me in?
-l wouldn't even think about it.

132
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,838
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.

133
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,984
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?

134
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,051
Well, l'm sure l had a good reason.

135
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,212
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say l wouldn't be next?

136
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,553
-But you know me.
-l thought l did.

137
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:40,333
l really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.

138
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,232
You know, l'm not of your faith.
ln fact, l'm not a very religious person.

139
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:49,104
But l do feel as if l'm in need
of some guidance here.

140
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:52,370
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?

141
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,113
l have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...

142
00:07:56,283 --> 00:08:00,185
...although l think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...

143
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,553
...people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.

144
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:09,594
No. No, thank you.
l'm not very hungry.

145
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,856
Anyway...

146
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,594
...this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.

147
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,705
-How wonderful.
-Yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,333
Well, for some reason...

149
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,605
...well, l find myself
just overcome...

150
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,876
...with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.

151
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,579
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...

152
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:37,747
...enter into this holiest of unions?

153
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,223
No, no. No, it doesn't.

154
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,721
No joy. No joy whatsoever. lt just--
The whole thing makes me...

155
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,594
...sick.

156
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,526
You know, Elaine...

157
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:53,434
...very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.

158
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,666
Yeah, l don't know
what that means.

159
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:59,511
Well, for example,
say there's a forest--

160
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,980
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.

161
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:08,144
You know? l'm smart.
l'm attractive.

162
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:12,019
You know, my temple
has many single functions.

163
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:13,626
Oh, no, that's okay.

164
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:18,731
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps l could...?

165
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,524
No, l don't think so.

166
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:25,434
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.

167
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,373
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.

168
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,512
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

169
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,373
-Another caffe latte?
-Yeah, you better believe it.

170
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,110
-Since when are you so trendy?
-Hey, baby, l set the trends.

171
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,413
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?

172
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,614
l don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.

173
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,259
l've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...

174
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,621
...and haven't looked back.

175
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,263
Look, <i>Plan 9 from Outer Space</i>
is playing tomorrow night.

176
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,422
-One show only.
-l've always wanted to see it.

177
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,465
l was supposed to see this
five years ago.

178
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,967
l was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.

179
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,628
We got screwed up
and missed it.

180
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,364
-Well, let's do it, huh?
-All right.

181
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,908
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.

182
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,739
See, that's littering.

183
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:08,211
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.

184
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,547
Maybe l will.

185
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,582
-Hi.
-Hey, how was your day?

186
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,386
Good. Good day.

187
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:23,428
-How was--? How was your day?
-Oh, it was okay.

188
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,693
-So, what's going on?
-Oh, nothing much.

189
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:30,325
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.

190
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,837
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.

191
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,532
The Lauers? Really?

192
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,735
-Do you not wanna go?
-No, no. l wanna go.

193
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,379
So, what did Jerry have to say?

194
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:45,349
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.

195
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,625
l had an unbelievable idea
today.

196
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,922
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.

197
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,657
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
lt's something else.

198
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,164
-You ready for this?
-Yeah.

199
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,632
-Okay, how about this?
-What?

200
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,895
-All right.
-Okay.

201
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,468
We get married...

202
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
...March 2 1 st,
the first day of spring.

203
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,044
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?

204
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,477
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.

205
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:17,811
l just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.

206
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:21,785
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that--

207
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:27,625
lf you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!

208
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,262
No, no, still marry. Still marry.

209
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,730
-No, you don't love me.
-No, no, still love. Still love.

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,362
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...

211
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:39,938
-...and that l was making a mistake.
-No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.

212
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,166
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.

213
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:45,403
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. lt's fine, really.

214
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,070
-You sure?
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.

215
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,652
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.

216
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:55,314
Let me take a guess.

217
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,817
She cried and you caved.

218
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,789
-How did you know that?
-l live and breathe, my friend.

219
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:07,161
l live and breathe.

220
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,599
l felt terrible. l thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.

221
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,104
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.

222
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,209
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.

223
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:17,844
You gotta build up your immunity.

224
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,344
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.

225
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:23,449
lt's like she was on fire.
l was just trying to put her out.

226
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,480
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.

227
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,657
l didn't have any sex.

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,487
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?

229
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,132
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.

230
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,759
l missed out on the make-up sex.

231
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,227
ln your situation...

232
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:48,068
...the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...

233
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:51,268
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.

234
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:55,712
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.

235
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:06,148
Look, l can tell you're very upset,
but l'm sorry, l'm not going.

236
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,386
Did you hear that?

237
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:15,333
l can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.

238
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:17,936
Are you gonna eat those fries?

239
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:24,371
This is amazing.

240
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,878
Thank you. Thank you very much.

241
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,348
l'm going back in.

242
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,279
Feel better.

243
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,224
Poor bastard.

244
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,567
Good evening, Rabbi.

245
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:50,295
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?

246
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,098
Well, Rabbi. Well.

247
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,900
l trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?

248
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:58,533
-Yeah, that's right.
-l hope she's feeling better.

249
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,008
What do you mean?

250
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,045
-She didn't tell you?
-No.

251
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,548
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...

252
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,119
...has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.

253
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:12,057
-ls that so?
-Oh, yes.

254
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,217
ln fact, she told me
that she wishes...

255
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,727
...she was the one
who was getting married.

256
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:18,929
Really?

257
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,830
-She came off as pretty desperate.
-l didn't know any of this.

258
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:27,167
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.

259
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:32,108
l recall the word ''loser'' peppered
throughout our conversation.

260
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,348
Well, this all comes as news to me.

261
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,346
-Hi.
-Hi, how was your day?

262
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:42,989
Good. Good day.

263
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:46,058
-How was your day?
-Oh, it was okay.

264
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:50,629
-So, what's going on?
-Oh, nothing much, you know.

265
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:54,234
l went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.

266
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,433
Could l--?
Could l talk to you for a minute?

267
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,132
Yeah, sure.

268
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,867
All right.

269
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,344
You see, this is the thing.

270
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:18,688
l just feel like l can't do this
in December.

271
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:23,159
l just feel like l need a little more time
because l feel like l'm not ready yet.

272
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,026
l'm frightened and l'm scared.

273
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,638
And l just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.

274
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:37,002
But l could do it in March.
l promise. l promise.

275
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:40,738
No more postponements. l just
need three more months, please.

276
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:43,576
Oh, George, George.

277
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,081
Of course.

278
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,688
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.

279
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,347
-Yeah?
-Oh, don't worry.

280
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:55,655
Yes, of course, of course.

281
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,762
l have that magazine article for you.

282
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,195
You know, l had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.

283
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,534
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,507
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.

285
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,475
Yeah, we talked earlier.

286
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,343
Yes, l know, l know.

287
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:23,087
-What does that mean?
-Nothing. Nothing.

288
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,228
-He didn't mention...?
-Yes, he did.

289
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:35,391
-He told you about the conversation?
-Oh, we had quite a little chat.

290
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:39,232
-He told you about--?
-Yes, how you are jealous of George.

291
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:41,874
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.

292
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,600
He told you that? How could he?

293
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:46,541
And it didn't take much
prodding either, l have to say.

294
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:49,705
-Can he do that?
-He did.

295
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,614
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?

296
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,652
That's what's so fascinating.

297
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,818
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.

298
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,086
-They'll never let you in with it.
-Why not?

299
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:05,322
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.

300
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:08,430
-Well, that's stupid.
-That's the rule.

301
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,662
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.

302
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,410
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.

303
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:23,212
-So nice to see you again.
-Yeah.

304
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,750
Can l offer you some
kasha varnishkes?

305
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,356
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
l'd like to ask you a question.

306
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:34,585
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what l talked to you about?

307
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:39,596
-Was that a problem for you?
-Of course it was problem for me!

308
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,197
You didn't--? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?

309
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,338
Well, let's see....

310
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:51,101
l seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1 F.

311
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,267
Mrs. Winston?

312
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,011
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...

313
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,650
...and l happened to mention
to her...

314
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,719
...how you felt it was never
going to ''happen'' for you.

315
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,618
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?

316
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:07,983
Don Ramsey?

317
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,324
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?

318
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,193
Oh, him.

319
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,825
Well, this morning l happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.

320
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,029
Oh, my God, you didn't.

321
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,267
Excuse me.

322
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:25,511
Pardon me. Excuse us.

323
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:30,507
My coffee!

324
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,587
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?

325
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:43,889
Nothing. Nothing.

326
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,931
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?

327
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,194
l don't have anything. What?
Ask him.

328
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,003
All right. Come on, coffee boy.

329
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,699
-What?
-Come on, now. Here we go.

330
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:03,840
l mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.

331
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,008
l ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...

332
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,654
...l mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.

333
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,724
Elaine, if l could say a word here
about the Jewish people.

334
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,491
That man in no way
represents our ability...

335
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:21,600
...to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.

336
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:23,633
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?

337
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,032
No.

338
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,265
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.

339
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:32,572
-Feelings of resentment, hostility.
-Yeah, yeah. So what?

340
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:38,650
-Hey.
-Georgie, congratulations!

341
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,721
Oh, my God, l haven't seen you
since it happened.

342
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,414
l couldn't be happier for you.

343
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:47,323
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

344
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,157
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.

345
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,598
Deserve?
l don't know about deserve.

346
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:55,757
Are you kidding?

347
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,871
l have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.

348
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,998
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.

349
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:05,176
Yeah, l guess l'm getting older.

350
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:09,276
Well, l just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.

351
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:14,079
l've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.

352
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,551
My most just...

353
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,190
-...heartfelt congratulations.
-Yeah, thanks.

354
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:19,825
Listen, if you ever get a date...

355
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:22,621
...maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

356
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,428
Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.

357
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,398
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?

358
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,867
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?

359
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:34,131
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah.

360
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,642
-Boy, she is something, isn't she?
-Yeah, she's something else.

361
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,303
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or...?

362
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:45,884
-Nope. l wept like a baby.
-What?

363
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:49,283
Well, l started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...

364
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,287
...l just burst into tears.

365
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,983
-You cried?
-l bawled uncontrollably.

366
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:57,824
l just poured my guts out. And
l'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.

367
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,622
l never realized how powerful
these tears are.

368
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,237
l could have postponed it
another five years if l wanted to.

369
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:05,829
-Hey.
-Hey.

370
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,497
Sorry about that movie thing.
l was joking around.

371
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,165
Sorry? Are you kidding?

372
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,072
You did me the biggest favor
of my life.

373
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:16,113
l spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

374
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:20,379
-Suing? What for?
-The coffee was too hot.

375
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,652
-lt's supposed to be hot.
-Not that hot.

376
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:36,532
The prophet lsaiah tells us
that without friends...

377
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,763
...our lives are empty
and meaningless.

378
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,341
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.

379
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,808
l just met this guy the other day.

380
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,777
<i>A young lady I know,</i>
<i>let's call her Elaine...</i>

381
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,850
<i>...happened to find herself</i>
<i>overwhelmed...</i>

382
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:01,153
<i>...with feelings of resentment</i>
<i>and hostility for her friend...</i>

383
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,023
<i>...let's call him George.</i>

384
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:08,390
<i>She felt that George</i>
<i>was somewhat of a loser...</i>

385
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:13,632
<i>...and that she was the one</i>
<i>who deserved to be married first.</i>

386
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,877
<i>She also happened to mention to me</i>
<i>that her friend had wondered...</i>

387
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:24,142
<i>...if going to a prostitute while you're</i>
<i>engaged is considered cheating.</i>

388
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,582
<i>His feeling was...</i>

389
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:31,883
<i>...they're never going</i>
<i>to see each other again...</i>

390
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:34,356
<i>...so, what's the difference?</i>

391
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,592
<i>But that is a subject</i>
<i>for another sermon.</i>

392
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:42,633
<i>And now I'd like to close</i>
<i>with a psalm.</i>
