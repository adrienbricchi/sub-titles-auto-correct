00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,540
Every morning, when you wake up,
it's like you're born all over again.

1
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:09,242
You can't see, you can't talk.

2
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:12,614
You're on your way to the bathroom
trying to remember, ''How do l walk?''

3
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:14,379
Like you've never
been alive before.

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,354
But if any invention marks
the decline of human civilization...

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,288
...it would have to be
the snooze alarm.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,223
The snooze alarm
is based on the idea...

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,263
...that when the alarm goes off,
you are not getting up.

8
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,957
You're not even awake,
you're already a failure.

9
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:30,195
They should sell the snooze alarm
with an unemployment application...

10
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,702
...and a bottle of tequila.

11
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:35,502
Just make it a complete
pathetic loser kit.

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,123
-Hello.
-<i>This is your wake-up service</i>.

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,782
<i>It's 7: 1 5.</i>

14
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,327
Oh, God.

15
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,057
Oh, l could use
a few more hours sleep.

16
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,464
-<i>Hot date last night?</i>
-l wish.

17
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:04,366
<i>A woman with a sexy voice</i>
<i>like yours...</i>

18
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:07,269
<i>...it's hard to believe</i>
<i>you're waking up alone.</i>

19
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:10,270
Really?

20
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,673
Thank you...

21
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:15,714
...Tri-State Wake-Up Service
person.

22
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:20,513
-Call me James.
-Oh, all right, James.

23
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:25,320
The wake-up guy asked you out?

24
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,721
Yeah, l've never seen him...

25
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:30,193
...but l feel like we have
this weirdly intimate relationship.

26
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,629
You know, l mean, l'm lying in bed.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,665
l'm wearing my nightie.

28
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,235
l don't know. A blind date?

29
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,568
You wanna go out with
my cousin Holly. You've never met her.

30
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,368
Yeah, but l've seen pictures of her.

31
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,169
At least l've spoken to my guy.

32
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,676
You're going out on a deaf date.

33
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,315
l think l'd rather go on a deaf date
than a blind date.

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,543
The question is, would you rather
date the blind or the deaf?

35
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,846
-Now, you're off on a topic.
-That's interesting.

36
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:57,150
See, now, l think
l would rather date the deaf.

37
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,553
Because l think the blind...

38
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:01,251
...would probably be
a little messy around the house.

39
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,626
l mean, let's face it,
they're not gonna get all the crumbs.

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,892
You're constantly
walking around with a sponge.

41
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,335
See, l disagree.
l would rather date the blind.

42
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,134
You know, you could let the house go,
you let yourself go.

43
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,073
A good-looking blind woman...

44
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:18,439
...doesn't know
you're not good enough for her.

45
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:20,945
l think she'd figure it out
soon enough.

46
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,709
What?

47
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,410
What is this?

48
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,249
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.

49
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:32,450
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?
What are you turning into?

50
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,652
A healthy person.

51
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:39,062
-You squirted me.
-Oh, sorry.

52
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,394
Boy, that stings.

53
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,703
George, have you seen Morgan?

54
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,336
-No.
-He's been coming in later and later.

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,310
-ls there something wrong?
-No, not that l know of.

56
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,074
Really?

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,581
Well, make sure he signs this.

58
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,550
George, if there's a problem
with Morgan, you can tell me.

59
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,282
Morgan? No, he's doing a great job.

60
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,492
l understand.

61
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,696
l still can't believe
you're going out on a blind date.

62
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,265
l'm not worried.
He sounds like he's good-looking.

63
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:17,103
You're going by sound?
What are we, whales?

64
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,434
l think l can tell.

65
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:21,768
What percentage of people
are good-looking?

66
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:24,571
-Twenty-five percent.
-Twenty-five percent?

67
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,271
No way. lt's like 4 to 6 percent.

68
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:28,847
lt's a 20-1 shot.

69
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,711
-You're way off.
-Way off?

70
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:34,582
You been to the Motor Vehicle Bureau?
lt's a leper colony down there.

71
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,357
So basically, what you're saying...

72
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,925
...is 95 percent of the population
is undateable?

73
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,789
Undateable.

74
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:44,022
Then how are all these people
getting together?

75
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:45,756
Alcohol.

76
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,462
What is your problem?

77
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,795
No problem here.

78
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:53,338
You keep winking at me.
That's really obnoxious.

79
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:57,111
-l had no idea.
-Right there. You just did it again.

80
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:59,142
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

81
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,474
lt's from that grapefruit
Jerry squirted at me.

82
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,014
Oh, you're eye still hurts?

83
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:06,813
Yeah, yeah, you must have squirted
a piece of pulp in it too.

84
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,683
Pulp couldn't make it
across the table.

85
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:11,086
Pulp can move, baby.

86
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,150
Why can't you eat a real breakfast?

87
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,160
l eat healthy. lf l have to take out
an eye, that's the breaks.

88
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,825
Wait a minute. l must have
been winking down at the office.

89
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,469
That's why Mr. Wilhelm
was acting so <i>misterioso</i>.

90
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,673
What did he think,
you were flirting with him?

91
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,076
No, he thought l was hiding
something about Morgan.

92
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,739
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Jughead.

93
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:37,351
Hello, Archie, Veronica,
Mr. Weatherbee.

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,078
Hey.

95
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,819
-ls this Don Mattingly's signature?
-Yeah.

96
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,219
And Buck Showalter's?

97
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,829
lt's an interoffice envelope. lt gets
passed around all over the office.

98
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,759
Hey, can l show this
to my buddy Stubs?

99
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:52,490
He runs a sports-memorabilia store.

100
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,430
He'll pay top-dollar
for pro autographs.

101
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,002
Yeah, like l'm gonna risk my job
with the New York Yankees...

102
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,730
...to make a few extra bucks.

103
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,340
No, of course not.

104
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,080
No, you see, Don Mattingly
signed this envelope.

105
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,148
Then he sent it to room 31 8...

106
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,718
...where it was received and signed for
by manager Buck Showalter.

107
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,980
l don't know. An envelope?

108
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:16,919
-lt doesn't really cut it.
-Why?

109
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,053
And what is this?

110
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,286
A birthday card.

111
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:24,863
Signed by the entire
Yankee organization?

112
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,092
This could be worth something.

113
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:31,135
-ls that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
-Hello.

114
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:32,897
You got that birthday card?

115
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:36,842
-Birthday card?
-Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card.

116
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,876
Wilhelm said you'd have it
for me to sign.

117
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:43,073
Oh, yeah. l'll have that for you
right after lunch.

118
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:46,948
-Fine. l'll be back after my massage.
-Of course, your massage.

119
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:49,385
Enjoy your massage.

120
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,965
-Hello?
-Elaine?

121
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,866
-James.
-Yes.

122
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,942
Hello.

123
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,640
l can't believe Elaine's
never taken you here.

124
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,580
l'm really not
much of a meat eater.

125
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,547
You don't eat meat?

126
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,246
-What are you, one of those--?
-No, l'm not one of those.

127
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,454
When we were little girls...

128
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,323
...Grandma Mema would take us
to a matinee and dinner here.

129
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:32,523
-Grandma Mema?
-Elaine must have mentioned Mema.

130
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,600
No, l think l would have
remembered Mema.

131
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,465
Oh, well, that's typical.
Elaine never liked Grandma Mema.

132
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:39,133
Ready?

133
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,640
l'll have the porterhouse, medium rare,
baked potato with sour cream.

134
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,041
What do you recommended
besides a steak?

135
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,043
The lamb chops are good.

136
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:50,308
Anything lighter?
How do you prepare the chicken?

137
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:53,783
lt's a full bird, stuffed with ham,
topped with Gorgonzola.

138
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,790
You know, l'll just have a salad.

139
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:01,825
Thank you.

140
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,554
<i>Just a salad.</i>

141
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,255
<i>Just a salad.</i>

142
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,832
<i>Just a salad.</i>

143
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,662
Here you are. Hey, boys.

144
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,565
Hey, you. Hey, you. Hi.

145
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,833
These are your dogs?

146
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,407
Yeah, when you live alone,
your dogs are all you have.

147
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,339
Do you like dogs?

148
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:23,182
Shut up, you stupid little mutt!

149
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:28,318
-Dogs? Oh, l love dogs.
-Boys, this is Elaine.

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,251
l'm sorry.
They're usually very friendly.

151
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:36,862
Hey.

152
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,696
Hey, Mr. Morgan,
how was your massage?

153
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,837
l had to cancel it. For some reason
my wife got it into her head...

154
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,734
...that it was more
than just a massage.

155
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,941
-Really?
-We got into this big fight at lunch.

156
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,806
-l'll be sleeping on the couch.
-Listen, don't oversleep.

157
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,913
-You can't afford to be late again.
-l know.

158
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:57,983
Somebody's been giving Wilhelm
the impression l've been slacking off.

159
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:01,455
Hey, you know, you should try
my friend's wake-up service.

160
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,021
She's swears by this thing.

161
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,953
You may be my only friend
around here.

162
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:08,254
-By the way, you got that card?
-Not yet.

163
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:10,761
Make sure Steinbrenner
doesn't get it till l sign it.

164
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:11,920
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,996
l mean, l just don't understand it.

166
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:17,069
As soon as l met these dogs,
they started growling at me.

167
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:21,334
Well, maybe his dogs heard about
how you tried to kidnap that other dog.

168
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,000
These mutts like to gossip.

169
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,473
So have you talked to Holly?

170
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,047
Did she mention our lunch?

171
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,383
-Kind of.
-Well, what do you mean, ''Kind of''?

172
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:36,382
l mean, she thought it was
kind of strange to just order a salad.

173
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:40,419
You know, for a man.

174
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,620
Like a quiche thing?

175
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,129
You're in the ballpark.

176
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,892
Salad? What was l thinking?

177
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,798
Women don't respect salad eaters.

178
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,665
You got that right.

179
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,467
You're going over there
for dinner tonight, right?

180
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:58,806
-What is she making?
-l don't know. l'm sure it had parents.

181
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,711
Call her up.
She won't mind if you come.

182
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:07,411
Oh, don't worry, l'll be there.
And l'll be packing an artery.

183
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,489
Well, Mr. Weatherbee.

184
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:14,827
Do you have
that Yankee envelope?

185
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:16,787
l sure do.

186
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:19,121
-There you are.
-Hey.

187
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,098
Think you're gonna be very pleased
when you see what's inside.

188
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,603
-What is this?
-Your cut of the loot.

189
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,002
Stubs gave me $200...

190
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,609
...for the autographed birthday card
that was inside.

191
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,370
Who told you to sell the card?

192
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,574
-You did.
-No, l didn't.

193
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,047
Well, not in so many words...

194
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:40,813
...but l believe
we had an understanding.

195
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,651
l was not winking, you idiot.

196
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,849
That was the grapefruit.
lt's like acid.

197
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:48,961
l need that card back.
lt's Steinbrenner's. l was responsible.

198
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,190
Well, Stubs sold it to some guy
whose kid is in the hospital.

199
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:55,301
Well, get it back.
lt's very important.

200
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,635
Look, you want me
to get it back or not?

201
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,673
Get it back!

202
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,904
This is such a lovely
table setting, Holly.

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,810
-Where did you get these napkins?
-They were Grandma Mema's.

204
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,244
-l don't remember them.
-You wouldn't.

205
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,012
She only used them
on special occasions.

206
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,851
Special occasions? lt wasn't special
when my family visited?

207
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,687
Everybody like mutton?

208
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,224
Mutton.

209
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,522
Hope you didn't cut the fat off.

210
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,202
-Are you Bobby?
-Yes.

211
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,903
Well, l heard that you have
a very special birthday card...

212
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,237
...with all the Yankee
autographs on it.

213
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:41,813
-Sure do, mister.
-Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah.

214
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:44,246
Boy, Stubs sure went to town
with this thing, huh?

215
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,716
Yeah, well, Bobby,
what if l told you...

216
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:49,447
...that a very important person
at the New York Yankees...

217
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,885
...needed this card back?

218
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:54,892
Oh, no. l'd never part with this card
for anything in the world.

219
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,690
Well, Bobby....

220
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,391
-Who's your favorite Yankee?
-Paul O'Neill.

221
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,595
What if l will get Paul O'Neill
to hit a home run just for you?

222
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:08,139
-Really? Paul O'Neill would do that?
-For you, he would.

223
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,038
Could he hit two home runs?

224
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,701
Two?

225
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,871
Sure, kid. But then you gotta promise
you'll do something for me.

226
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,143
l know. Get out of this bed one day
and walk again.

227
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,787
Yeah, that would be nice,
but l just need the card.

228
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,991
What about this candelabra?

229
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,992
That was Grandma Mema's also.

230
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:31,222
She bought it on her trip to Europe
in 1 926.

231
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:35,298
Jerry, l'm thrilled you like my mutton.
l was afraid you only ate salad.

232
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,939
Hey, salad's got nothing
on this mutton.

233
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,808
That is so funny.
Did you just make that up?

234
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,638
l wish l could take credit for it.

235
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,578
lt's actually a line my butcher uses
when we're chewing the fat.

236
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,919
How about that beautiful desk
over there?

237
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:58,189
Yeah, that was in Mema's study.

238
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,190
l love that desk.

239
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,693
What did you do,
ransack the place after she died?

240
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,195
ls this some fine mutton.

241
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,357
You know what?
l'm getting out of here.

242
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,391
Can l borrow your jacket?

243
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,902
-Well, the thing is--
-lt's cold out, okay?

244
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,835
l didn't bring my own, okay? Jerry.

245
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:15,669
Jerry!

246
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,834
God forbid l should
borrow one from Holly.

247
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,373
lt might have belonged
to Grandma Mema.

248
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,472
Thanks for mutton.

249
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:31,120
Nice doggy.

250
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,657
l'm a nice person.

251
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,191
Don't believe what you hear.

252
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:38,297
l love dogs. l really do.

253
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,658
-Where are the napkins?
-What?

254
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:45,066
Grandma Mema's napkins.
Two are missing.

255
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,638
Elaine took them, didn't she?

256
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,166
l don't know about that.

257
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:53,211
-Have you got any floss?
-You heard her. She coveted them.

258
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,405
l bet she took them just to spite me.

259
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,743
She's probably having a laugh
about it right now.

260
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,784
Down, doggy!

261
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,964
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?

262
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,569
-Did you hide the dogs?
-Yeah, they're in the kitchen.

263
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,105
lt's okay. Okay. Quiet!

264
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,574
-What's going on?
-Oh, God.

265
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,042
These dogs were chasing me.

266
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:27,441
And no cabs were stopping.

267
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,174
l had to get off the street.
l remembered you lived here.

268
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,784
Why were dogs chasing you?

269
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:34,216
They just don't like me.
lt's a long story.

270
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,856
l can tell you about it someday,
but not right now.

271
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:41,058
l would ask you to stay, but l only have
the sofa bed, and it's where l sleep.

272
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:45,088
Well, we'll have to sleep
head-to-toe.

273
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,627
-Head-to-toe?
-Head-to-toe.

274
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,548
Hey, wake up.

275
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,098
lt's 8:30. You were supposed
to wake me up at 7:1 5.

276
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:22,099
l'm sorry. l didn't get any sleep.
You kept kicking me in the face.

277
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,533
You're a wake-up guy.
Don't you have calls to make?

278
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,935
l'll make them later.

279
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,076
-Have you seen Morgan?
-He's not here?

280
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,478
No, he's late again.

281
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:39,710
That's impossible.
l got him a wake-up service.

282
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,411
You don't have to cover for him.

283
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,748
He's gonna be gone soon...

284
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,448
...and l'm gonna recommended you
for his job.

285
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:46,957
Gone?

286
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,689
Sounds like all that winking
got you a promotion.

287
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:52,491
l don't want Morgan's job.
He's got a lot of work to do.

288
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,294
Hey, Elaine, your friend
never woke up Mr. Morgan.

289
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,664
Yeah, well, he was tired.
He had feet in his face.

290
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,666
My cousin Holly
is completely insane.

291
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:05,175
She keep calling and accusing me
of stealing her napkins.

292
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:07,176
-Napkins?
-l mean, why?

293
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,178
Why would l take
her stupid napkins?

294
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:12,375
Because they were in the pockets
of my jacket.

295
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:13,781
-They were?
-Yes.

296
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,650
l was using them
to spit out the mutton.

297
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,984
You spit it out?

298
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,526
l had dogs chasing me for that.

299
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,959
l was almost mauled
because of that mutton.

300
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,930
-What exactly is mutton?
-l don't know.

301
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,194
And l didn't wanna find out.

302
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,860
So where's my jacket?

303
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,207
l must have left it as James'.

304
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,707
Spend the night at James', did we?

305
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,711
Yeah, but we reversed positions,
so there was no funny business.

306
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,714
-Reversed positions?
-Yeah, you know, head-to-toe.

307
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:49,881
So what?
Your genitals are still lined up.

308
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,886
No, because l slept
with my back to him.

309
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:02,865
-Mr. O'Neill?
-Yeah.

310
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,867
Yeah, look, you don't know me.

311
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,029
All right. l can give you
an autograph here...

312
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:11,405
...but my pen's kind of screwed up and
you'll probably only get like half a P.

313
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,876
No, it's not that.
lt's about a boy in the hospital.

314
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,880
l was wondering if you could
do something to lift his spirits.

315
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,247
-l can help you there.
-l promised you'd hit two home runs.

316
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,888
-You what?
-Yeah, you know, a couple of dingers.

317
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,752
You promised a kid in the hospital
l'd hit two home runs?

318
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,360
-Yeah, what? No good?
-No, it's no good. lt's terrible.

319
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,053
You don't hit home runs like that.

320
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,698
lt's hard to hit home runs.
Where did you get two from?

321
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,766
Well, two is better than one.

322
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:37,301
That's ridiculous.
l'm not a home-run hitter.

323
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,632
-Well, Babe Ruth did it.
-He did not.

324
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,603
You're saying
that Babe Ruth was a liar?

325
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,040
l'm not calling him a liar, but he wasn't
stupid enough to promise two.

326
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,442
Well, maybe l did
overextend myself.

327
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,309
How did you get in here anyway?

328
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:56,019
Oh, hi, Elaine. You know, l lost
all of my 6:30 clients because of you.

329
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,454
Yeah, well, why did you
have to stick your feet in my face?

330
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,827
Yes, l have the jacket. Hold on.

331
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,131
Fellas.

332
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,232
What do you got?

333
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:14,136
<i>The Yankees take the field</i>
<i>on a beautiful afternoon.</i>

334
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:16,435
lt's hot in here.

335
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,340
Hey, Bobby,
can l have some of your juice?

336
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,245
After Paul O'Neill
hits his first home run.

337
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,523
-Yeah?
-<i>It's Holly.</i>

338
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:35,321
-Come on up.
-<i>And the two-and-one pitch to O'Neill.</i>

339
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,953
<i>Towering shot to deep right field,</i>
<i>and it's gone!</i>

340
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,964
-Yeah!
-<i>A home run for Paul O'Neill.</i>

341
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:45,730
-<i>The Yanks lead 1-nothing.</i>
-Oh, yeah!

342
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,737
All right.

343
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,170
Yeah.

344
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:51,005
One more to go.

345
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,314
Hey, what's all this?

346
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,814
l decided l'm gonna
make you dinner.

347
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:59,543
Oh, l thought we were going out.

348
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,312
After you scarfed up my mutton...

349
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,286
...l had the irresistible urge
to make pork chops for you.

350
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,788
Well, l said hello to Franco for you.

351
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,229
-Franco?
-Your butcher down the street.

352
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,862
l bet he acted all aloof
like he didn't know me.

353
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:19,802
-A little.
-That is so Franco.

354
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:23,707
<i>Bottom of the eighth.</i>
<i>Score tied at 1 apiece.</i>

355
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,471
<i>Two and one to Paul O'Neill.</i>

356
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,549
Bobby, it's hard to hit two home runs
in one day, even for Paul O'Neill.

357
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,275
He can do it, Mr. Kramer.

358
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,886
l know he can. He'll do it for me.

359
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:41,223
<i>Long fly ball into deep left field,</i>
<i>and it drops just over Belle's head.</i>

360
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:44,694
<i>O'Neill's rounding second,</i>
<i>the ball rolling back to the wall.</i>

361
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:46,856
-<i>O'Neill heading for third.</i>
-Come on!

362
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,832
<i>O'Neill rounds third,</i>
<i>being waved in.</i>

363
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,231
Yeah! Go! Go!

364
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>And Martinez throws it</i>
<i>over Alomar's head.</i>

365
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,611
<i>O'Neill is safe at home,</i>
<i>the Yankees take the lead.</i>

366
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,378
lnside-the-park home run!

367
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,573
-Yes, he did it.
-All right.

368
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,446
Yeah, well,
l guess l'll be on my way.

369
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,714
<i>Now, that's being scored</i>
<i>a triple for Paul O'Neill...</i>

370
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,326
<i>...with a throwing error</i>
<i>charged to Martinez.</i>

371
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,721
Hey.

372
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:16,419
That's not a home run.

373
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,154
Well, maybe not technically, but--

374
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,196
You said he would hit
two home runs.

375
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,961
Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good.

376
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,230
-Well, you're not taking that card.
-Now, Bobby, Bobby. We had a deal.

377
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,772
Come on, give me that.

378
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,604
So is the chop
the way you like it?

379
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,939
l usually like mine
with an angioplasty.

380
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,481
Something really stinks to high--

381
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,649
Holly.

382
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:48,055
What are you doing here?

383
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,287
What everybody does here.
Cooking pork chops.

384
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,225
Listen, l'm meeting James here.

385
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,958
He's bringing over your jacket.

386
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:57,035
-And what about the napkins?
-Oh, God.

387
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,001
l didn't take your napkins.

388
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,436
-Then who did?
-Ask Jerry.

389
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:04,008
Hey, we can argue all night
over who took the napkins.

390
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:08,238
The point is, in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.

391
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:12,012
l still wanna know what happened
to that birthday card.

392
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:15,677
-Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
-No, sir. George never gave it to me.

393
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:17,084
That's right. l didn't.

394
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,953
l take full responsibility
for the card not being here, l--

395
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,357
-l got it.
-What's this?

396
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:25,589
Oh, it's a birthday card. Yeah.

397
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:28,093
George, by the way,
tomorrow night...

398
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,964
...Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.

399
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:35,132
George, this is beautiful.

400
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,708
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna have it mounted?

401
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:40,711
Yeah, you were probably
just gonna stick it in an envelope.

402
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:46,516
George, keep up the good work.

403
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,113
Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.

404
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,156
How am l supposed
to sign the card now, huh?

405
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:54,725
lt's already under glass.

406
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,555
Hi, James. Oh, this is--

407
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,694
Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?

408
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,303
Oh, bandanas. Aren't they cute?

409
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,804
You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?

410
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,708
Hey, what happened to my jacket?

411
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,208
Oh, the dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.

412
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,677
Somebody stuffed
some strange meat in the pockets.

413
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,578
-Was it mutton?
-Could have been.

414
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,810
You always stuff
meat in your pockets?

415
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:24,390
Sometimes l use the sofa.

416
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,160
You wanted to see me?

417
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,195
Yes, George.
Please, come in, come in.

418
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,765
Thanks for the card. l loved it.
lt made me feel good.

419
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,062
Word has it you were
the brains behind the thing.

420
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:39,797
No, no, not just me.
The whole organization.

421
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,201
Especially Mr. Morgan.

422
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:44,036
Morgan, Morgan. You know,
his name is absent from this card.

423
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,076
Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.

424
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,009
Oh, no, Morgan is a good man, sir.

425
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,445
You can stop.
Congratulations, you've got his job.

426
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,079
Well, thank you, sir. You know,
l'm not quite sure l'm right for it.

427
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,017
lt's done, George.
He's out, you're in.

428
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,588
-lt's a lot more work.
-l know.

429
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,281
A lot more responsibility.

430
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,154
-Long, long hours.
-l know.

431
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:02,852
Not much more money.

432
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,589
But you'll finally
get the recognition you deserve.

433
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,062
That's what l'm afraid of.

434
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:08,462
You know, Mr. Steinbrenner--

435
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:12,002
George, as painful as it is, l've had
to let a few people go over the years.

436
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,902
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella...

437
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,805
...Bucky Dent, Billy Martin...

438
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:19,343
...Dallas Green...

439
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,412
...Dick Hauser, Bill Virdon...

440
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:23,173
...Billy Martin...

441
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,580
...Stump Merrill, Billy Martin...

442
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,118
...Bob Lemon, Billy Martin...

443
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:30,483
...Gene Michael, Buck Showalter--

444
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,648
George, you didn't hear that
from me.

445
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,521
George!
